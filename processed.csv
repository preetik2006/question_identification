370319,slope has sus beginning 
370318,yeah sending private key sentry definitely needed 
370316,sentry selfhosted though usually decentralization finest 
370314,application ' sentry ' fault supposed key term seems rush develop gain market share first mobile wallet sol still auto approvals 
370313,not long ago even google analytics dapp punished decentralization gods 
370311,is error sentry application root cause  ?  iirc anything processes private keys meant sandboxed  ?  
370310,they post postmortem doc google doc link 
370309, do nt buy one things farfetched world mistake well closedsource does help anyone else verifying 
370308,they could also have backend crash visible user bug something could mistake tbh definetely ignorant user security since send sentry event containing mnemonic private key one would need store env variables dont really know how wallets made assume need actually store mnemonic plain text exclude when sending sentry does offer option 
370307,just poor form 
370306,not saying ' justified ' bad practice log anything sensitive user especially something like sentry 
370305, do nt write sentry error report new user event accident even intern 
370303, do nt buy 
370301,hanlon ' razor probably intern set logging 
370300,adding new user analytics literally stealing private key  ?  web3 logging deserved why does wallet need collect kind analytics  ?  log how much spend where  ?  thought send crash report should enough privacy reasons 
370299,yes sentry grabs environment variables saves tell sentry send specific data one line code dont understand why one would do honest 
370298,either way excuse huge nono problems solved years ago web2 blatant web3 basic application security audits logging output clearly ignored 
370297,sentry like many logging monitoring frameworks have strong destructuring 
370296,they ' using sentry analytics logging errors seems unnecessarily intentionally adding << xa0new userxa0 >> logging api endpoint taken last night

338115,that how works basically plebs have either many tokens use vote interesting antiwhale mechanics voting system whole kinda broken right revamped 
338114, yeah d super cool basis bicameral house senate type voting system personally think representative democracy work better direct democracy lower level decision making think s good arguments 
338113,ah yeah guess theory plebs would split plebs lots tokens plebs 1 tokens 
338112,we making personhood voting substrate chain though biometric consensus layer 
338111,how much released internally  ?  mean start 100m right away released 2m circulation per week how fast  ?  
338110,it tricameral theory plebs council technical committee practice reallynthere proof personhood despite us knowing people council tech committee actual unique people does really help regards technical decentralization decision making 
338109, really nt democratizing governance definition oligarchizing time s likely best do 100 believe need move forward 
338108, s personhood voting dot right  ?  s token voting board directors what understand  ?  teh technical board actually replaced token vote  ?  
338107, clear system would rely sort unique personhood thing which does nt yet exist 
338106, agree lot different ways improve voting system chosing way traditional llc works board directors etc exotic methods though moment m interested question does problem mentioned really exists  ?  yes looks strange re trying decentralize democratize almost everything talking fear governments amazon etc time whole system affected one person cz 
338105,yeah combine random selection block producer boom higher decentralization lower incentives run many nodes 
338104,this works really well systems enough validator room lowcapacity validator systems much whales tend make bunch validators push everyone 
338103,this proposal interesting terms centralizationdecentralization commonwealthimosmosisdiscussion4070flatfeepervalidator 
338102,that kind how polkadot works right ways got ta say loving 
338101,obviously would make decision making even way slower already see board directors elected way maybe even liquid voting where users delegate tokens directors 
338100, ve mentioned couple times really hope long term crypto moves away token voting bicameral system like house senate one side votes straight tokens one side 1 vote per unique human guess small minimum token requirement things pass get passed 
338099,"we ' always ready paranoidal low level decentralisation cryptoweb3defi stablecoins which affected usa ' decisions usdc data storage which rely centralized products node networks ' dependence centralized infrastructure etcnnat time almost definative products rely decentralised governance which means token holders "" power "" largest token holders biggest defiprotocols how much power do have  ?  brief analysis ethplorer snapshot shows picture example uni aave dydx 175m8m holdings one biggest token holderaverage number votes last proposals uni 15m250k aave 25m25m dydx guess "" one biggest token holder ""  ?  binance least wallets tagged ethplorer binance ' nnas understand binance token holder participate governance though usually cex ' ' do binance would want become "" malicious actor "" does have power propose first suspend withdrawals stake govtokens needed vote "" malicious proposal "" hurt defiecosystem  ?  yes ' look binance cex ' like potential single points failure defiworld  ?  hope mistake logic "

337967, yo peeps whats cost effective way get access eth node without running read data blockchain  ?  need able serve peaks traffic tens thousands users peak times  ?  m told using infura alchemy rack thousands fees what using rpcs  ?  essentially need provider when users dont have metamask havent connected yet 
337966,what scammy rug wow

337945,you knocked right door ivangbi great builder narratives 
337944,thank  
337943, tmelobsterdao 
337942,hey guys name jeremy bragin film producer currently working docuseries one russia ' largest vod platformsnni ' looking connect lobsterdao team nncan possibly get touch  ?  u0001f91d 
337941,now sounds like dumb question think various protocols offering smart contracts service scaas uniswap provides scaas form permissionless liquidity pools where anyone deploy combination 2 erc20 tokensnngnosis safe provides scaas proxy implementation where new proxy contracts deployed created point canonical gnosis safe interface contract contains logic needed transactions nnwhat would reasons why two different forms how people deploy smart contracts  ?  what would happen uniswap used proxy implementation liquidity pools instead  ?  
337940,quite interesting thanks 
337939,here playbook get lent tokens mm which fine carry risk get spread also usually get given free option receive tokens say 6month price k 
337938,mm means providing spread ask bids takes make market 
337937,that have ask even decide tell first place ' opaque also depends work require notional capital thenother side book use like wintermute what time period profit split engagement what directionally think asset usually ' mm what invest ' semantics basically ' find what looking trying deduct behavior sheer involvement mms magic 
337936,okay do do one side  ?  like possible service provides liquidity sells letting buys volatile  ?  
337935,not top close maintain tight spread larger orders happen without moving market much also prevents massive abritrage oppose where one scamware cex depegs another actually has volume well reality arb yeah 
337934,what does mean when alameda research says provide market making services  ?  essentially buy good portion supply makes continuous buys sells essentially always top bid ask orderbook  ?  
337933,sounds good how much pay delegators  ?  
337932,no vote exit dao give money 
337931, delegate u ivan 
337929,but got ta verify audit chain code smart contracts 
337928, do  ?  s nothing unique unprecedented people think app devs interested faffing around consensus like make app people selling socalled app chains 
337927,agreed also question how many differently optimized chains need build games certainly must level makes sense 
337926,they well like osmosis dydx dfk ... 
337925, dont know need time see 
337924,question eth20l2 experts nnthere several l2s fees tokens metisbobanii n defillamacomchainsrollupnnwill able become eth20 shards true optimistic rollups arbitrumoe able  ?  
337923,this sounds like building game engine make game worse os make app 
337922, do nt punch made typos thread ahah frenchies ans english long story 
337921, made thread twittercomchadasscapitalstatus1511302972206198785nnit fits ct topos aka might have quite degens part core hopefully sums things well give good first glance what do leveraging crypto nfts design economy undermine funding issues tradart b question act collecting live art end thread s github docs links nni leave introduction d really happy collect feedbacks d willing share really like guys seem well aware need position where listen take feedbacks account genuinely wan na meet new minds new mindsets kinda cool 
337920,if allow app specific parachain slots gets used bunch random projects might go anywhere 
337919,how security problem appchain  ?  validator 1 team 
337918,nah necessarily example dot have one parachain super low collator count effectively accomplishing without needing build bridges etc 
337917,so become appchain  
337916,this relates blockchain trilemma l1 couldnt handle dapp need find scaling solution 
337915, somehow figure highly reliable highly secure highly fast easy use bridges d agree definitely do nt see happening though 
337914, yeah agreed do nt see how one chain per app scale vs common optimized chains example dfk do nt need chain need gaming optimized one low decentralizatin high transaction throughput 
337913,like dfk subnet solve jewel inflation problem 
337912,cosmosibc future 
337911,appchains allow developers customize applications terms governance structure economic design underlying consensus algorithmneach appchain selfgoverned economy codedefined explicit processes reach agreements protocol upgrades 
337910,benefits appchain 
337909,let know anyone wants hire smart contract developer erc20 erc721 
337908, never understood why polkadot auctions slots allows parachains become pretty close app specific instead launch large amount interconnected common goods chains 
337907, ' think app chain thing think ' app agnostic optimized chains natively bridge 
337906, finitypolygontechnology 
337905,when dapps become bigger think have chain sure 
337904,nah okay u fine ser 
337903,lmao could banned ivangbi flushing 
337902,avax subnet seems lowest cost appchain atom needs connect ibc dot needs lot money becoming parachain 
337901,acala defi appchain

342106,but said would assume transaction original buyer would fail sure case 
342105, mean attacher would free ape could buy ape when knows someone else bradcasted transaction buy ape price beeing sold attacker buys x price claim apecoin sells interested buyer x price got free ape buyer end ape apecoin 
342104, probably dont understand scheme why would someone frontrun buy transaction  ?  how does buy transactions make difference case  ?  believe anybody buy apes still collect airdrop collect airdrop return back  ?  wrong  ?  
342103,yeah doubt

342101,interesting know

342099,yeah first ones hidden tax thatbwas decided based various random reason which could lead 50 correct im wrong though 
342098,this already done nftx when apecoin launched 
342097,and how could buyer protect case  ?  
342096, thought another attack using mev would possible when someone broadcast transaction buy let s say mutant ape still has ability claim apecoins someone could frontrun transaction maybe even flashloaning eth buy ape claim apecoin sell ape interested buyer eventually sell repay flashloan

369485,aave v3 does  ?  
369484,usdc euroc why ethc 
369483, mean objective have custodian behind have custody eth full instead using usdc 
369482,you do a la wbtc 
369481, s why goal use circle conduit 
369480, probably bridge risk what pairing curve 
369479,yeah starting point avalanche issuance synth assets order avoid bridges 
369478,but requires alrdy have assets avax understand correctly  ?  
369477,or bridges 
369476,this roughly security model bridge tho 
369475,as issuer would still taking lending protocols risk sc liquidations solvency etc 
369474,you could also have pure creditbased approach little direct backing mint syneth directly lending protocols offer lower interest rate borrows have curve pool peg 
369473, crosschain messaging s possible 
369472,you could have lending protocol where provide eth ethereum borrow whatever want remote chain 
369470,yeh 
369469,correct 
369468,the straightforwardless risky approach would still something similar stablecoin protocol makerliquity issuing synthetic eth 
369467,unless have different model mind 
369466,the perp also comes lending certain extent funding rate 
369465,but lets u get eth ethereum avalanche without bridging 
369464, solves price exposure part does nt solve fractured liquidity partnnif have eth eth wan na buy smth avax have funds avax avaxnative synth does nt help 
369463, julrach have sent long dm list things do right know hectic have time please go 
369462,could create curve pool spot vs perp maybe

355489, ca nt said nft native brand does nt have access amount infrastructure 
355487, see issue what right player apple decided release 10k pfp series apples random size bite marks came 10k phones replaces apple logo one nft s associated probably hit 
355477,not really sure how much trust do software qa new phone discord gets hacked monthly 
355476, yeah have birth certificate showing m bill gates grandson 
355474, material used nt concern tbh solid gold iphone valuable s iphone s wrapped gold many countries outside western ones iphone status symbol wrapping gold enhances wrapping chinese oem gold wo nt have value 
355464, think solid gold iphones bit different nfts nft based product argument brand value nfts give price inherent value material used

355449,unfortunately math fewer 8b use phone even fewer smartphone even fewer might care feature would able afford device even fewer need exactly what zhongfu has explained 
355447,oh apparently samsung flagships come inbuilt blockchain wallet 
355446, especially when consider s already possible people make crypto payments buy nfts etc phone still get fancy apple ecosystem stuff 
355445,999999  ?  ' saying nft crypto app payments has 8k growing user base dedicated pays exorbitant prices things uphold multi trillion crypto market  ?  8k sounds low guess optimism makes sense long term

355358, good examples cl price feed oracle aggegators wo nt make want consider walking across broken glass serious alternative  ?  
355357, ecdsa nonce reuse unlikely ll unaffected since wallets have sane impl 
355356,other accounts derived seed also unaffected 
355355, account wo nt necessarily drained anyway s limited what do one tx 
355354,as signing transaction masquerading message depends what transaction 
355353,interacting malicious contract typically have minimal impact unless something like rune 
355351,also related reuse ecdsa nonces resulted anyswap drained last year 
355349, re kinda different though ecdsa nonce reuse metamask letting sign transactions masqueraded messages

368373, might idea ll have look defi lama docs 
368372,ah well idk someone kind make list make publicnnone alternative could think scanning defi llama source connectors pasting

368322,meh debatable d nnbut yeah tldr what coiner wrote  
368321,beyond ' do much 
368320,the oracle should give assurances fetched correct value 
368319,so aggregate pass value onchain  ?  nnwhy should trust tho  ?   
368318, ' far cl defender ' service people use

368316,yeah ' really aggregation tho ' simply using api request  
368315,you send arbitrary http requests network 
368314,custom queries meaning  ?  
368313,well yeah go back point chain prices nnif want use chainlink send custom queries ' care much aggregation tech 
368312,don ' see happening yet 
368311,you do like liquity build closed loop never changeable end using cl tellor fall back anything ever happens ' fuckednnyou have immutability oracle level which means need good ways ensure ability change oracles ' get abused still designed way act ashoc 
368310, do nt know s dilemma much problem implementation really need something like uniswap where everything automated human tweaking ux chainlink 
368309,title bit catastrophistic considering criticism kind average used twaps hahanni think ' fair paper though bit truism point every attack every blockchain expense vs reward numbers mentioned manipulating 2m pool ' fee low

368299,this assumes want prices tho nnwhat data types  ?   
368298,maybe things actually build without feel somewhat groundbreaking 
368296,thanks let ' see think ' gon na people put thought oracles even tho ' one important parts setup  
368295,you could use chain oracles based amms nnthey get bad rep people ' bother implement flash loan guardrails b often have much less liquidity honeypotnnbut none like insurmountable issues

368292,but many things require oracle 
368291,one could also try building defi primitives ' require oracles like good old uni 
368290,"one way would make contracts immutable which would require projects able switch another one need adjust feed addremove nodes etc nnit would require dapps think oracles andor implement ways actively manage nnthat would remove multisig thus potential killswitch ' smoothconvenient enough nobody bothers nnwhy simply read "" ethusd "" without caring what actually happens underneath  "

368219,if usdc depegs have bigger issues holding dai  
368216,its overcollateralized 
368215,the vault ' liquidatable due psm

337052,people thinks ml analytics solve lt wont think regulators demand full kyc resource funds every single wallet used mixers couple years 
337051, think re vastly underestimating computing power thrown problems like nand remember do nt have deal computers today s crypto records gon na around 5 10 20 years when computing has improved even 
337050,putting 3852 eth withdrawing exact amount single wallet kind mistake talking even have problem plausible deniability 
337049,assuming split walelts withdrawn fixed increments like 1 eth 
337048,see likely reduce manual effort needed unmasking people made mistakes first place 
337047,yes when one person steals exactly 3852 eth fragments another wallet slowly receives 3852 eth course several weeks start make educated guesses need parallel construction 
337046,this like writing styles where have tons unique markers

337261,as someone ' gotten multiple tob audits recurring annual contract confidently say would have opinion tob one best firms space though ' saying others would find debate good work response quick remediation especially peg consider tob good 
337260, context which attack conducted would accountable auditor s combination decreased pair liquidity mev games arbitrage inefficiency 
337259,yeah remember discussing harry raised valid points low quality audits leading false sense user security 
337258,pretty sure trail bits would have caught least mentioned report consider comment economic well code relatedexploits top audit firms would definitely catch regardless great work responding situation quick impressive 
337257, clear m corporate audits always get community reviewers look critical code 
337256, issue would have caught audit volatility risk issue code exploit m finding alternative audits using defi olympiads experiment thanks bringing tho 
337255, hey nour get reasoning why do nt want get audit surely time has arrived least consider one  ?  dust settles would really help have professional set eyes look code dismiss findings ca nt deny useful process undertake nnwhat re pulling spite difficulties indeed impressive ways might prevent happening first place 
337254,dang ' conviction sounds like dola good hands good luck 
337253, ll continue raise rates across lending protocols dola 1 within next couple hours

337247,frax pretty small 25b market cap compared dai 10b considering how much attention frax gets why  ?  why does cmc show token 205 25b should top 60 cmc hates frax  ?  fxs seemed like good low buy 4pool news still seems expensive 
337245,if inv would have set require oracle update permissioned governance almost 0 chance happening would execute oracle update public mempool got frontrunned attack vector without attacker able update oracle 
337244,like probably linkies making party hack chainlink works permissioned system trusts entities behave intended

348976,and point q anyone possibly thinking novel stablecoin mechanics consider what aspects embrace dai frax 
348975, fair answer oranges vs apples might they d like they ve around long nnalso analogy seems bit faulty stable coin q nnthere least math economic reasons work highlight strengths think market game theory liquidity etcnni think good exercise answers given far may best anyone has that s ty 
348974,idk imo makes much sense asking discovered apples oranges today which would people prefer maybe someone else have better response question 
348973, good meant assuming know what know re relaunched whatever explanation patches scenario 
348972,you could also say dai utilizes volatile collateral providing speculative use case stablecoin rather using stable amos 
348971, imo answer question would likely speculativennyou could say since need less per frax minted vs dai given amount capital d able get fraxnnyou could also say since frax concept less battletested since re assuming situation which launched users would skeptical itnnwho knows  ?  
348970, commented someone earlier generally stablecoins guess suffers demandsupply problemnnwhile launched volatile week when eth high ups downs price demonstrated ability keep peg range problem s demand stablecoinnnalso stress testing peg limited advantage low cap thus low circulating supply nnhave nt seen project coming forward trust float yet afaik 
348969,is fair open ended question channel  ?  nnit seems broader appropriate nnwhat would grow faster launched today time  ?  nndai frax  ?  why  ?  nn edit assuming what know 
348968,np tbh find correct misconceptions important aspects product asking basic questions like what backs frax nnand first agreed pol aka grant total profit 12b mentioned screenshot said supply wasnt supply led good clarifications aroundnnthe q how tokens sent simultaneously burned seems generally interesting dont spot docs nnbut fair enough moved q frax channel ty tmefraxfinance201224

348959, re able clarify 2nd paragraph d great 
348958,you probably find frax eg staking stuff  ?  incentivizing liquidity  ?  docs tho 
348957, s much understand cuz have nt playing around much 
348956,dai requires minters hold assets vaults back dai gets minted value falls cr assets get liquidatednnfrax takes appropriate amounts usdc fxs gives frax usdc fxs isnt really way dai 
348955,to receive 088c 011x worth frax think theres small redemption fee iirc something half percent range 
348954,you redeem 1 frax anyone hold directly frax website 
348953, dai backed different assets when s backed usdc has lower collateral ratio 
348952,ok right btw gets things when  ?  depositing collateral borrower gets  ?  what cases  ?  eg what staking  ?  fxs frax locking fxs frax  ?  anything else mention top level summary mere mortals  ?  
348951,correct 
348950, dai frax quite different how work anyway ca nt quite compare crs directly 
348949,then zhongfu already responded

356014, githubcomrocketpoolrocketpoolresearchblobmasterpost 20mergemerge 20implementation 20researchmd 
356013,there additional risk rocketpool contract attack surface opposed solo time merge happens have fairly well battle tested though major vulnerabilities likely wouldnt seen withdrawals enabled 
356012,but makes seem surface anyway attractive 
356011,this back napkin math 
356010,and 009 036 eth 
356009,also rocketpool team considering lowering barrier entry 50 node supply 16 eth perhaps 25 8 eth plus 10 equivalent rpl nnso one would go 1 solo 4 rpl nodes 
356008, yeah shabby actually s like extra 59 apr 
356006,if get 018 every 5 weeks thats even better 
356005,so get 009 per 5 weeks thats shabby 
356004,right currently get 1 block ever 4 5 weeks 
356003,so running 2 rpl nodes instead 1 solo one would earn 2x priority fees though would rare much could add time 
356002,only when get propose block guess lol 
356001,yes precisely which makes running something like rocketpool bit attractive post merge node operator would earn priority fees 
356000,true though id imagine validators greedy regard lol 
355999,attestation proposal rewards get added validator balance priority fee goes fee recipient address 
355998, specific goes fee recipient necessarily validator 
355997, curious priority fee block reward go away post merge priority fees continue distributed validator assigned block 
355996,so 009 priority fee thanks

355720, s minimum goes minimum based active validators 
355719,and latter ways make queue larger without sacrificing security economic guarantees 
355718,both lido devs coredev working various ways reduce queue former different schemes obviate need regular key rotation

367221,does paper detail what complexities would  ?  see 2 possible ways amms could add complexities nn1 investors execution traders look pricing across venues amms order books otc desks batch auction exchanges etc would certainly impact how price discovery happens setting expectation where right current pricing amms have indirect way contributing price discoverynn2 amms used bootstrap liquidity when conducting large private transactions la like fashion sizable private investment fashion think already happening degree  ?  nnalso do have links paper  ?  
367220,yeah agree although depends way lps behave dex example have dex where lps always passive dex prices always long ' arbitrageur move back line 
367219, hmmm would nt worry even claim say cex dex s people have different views what pricing would reason s incentive trade across twonnor have case where s much execution risk dexs 
367218,yeah totally agree referring currently prevalent cfmms excluding univ3 which afaik bigger one moment requiring active lping require arbitrageurs eliminate price discrepancies yeah open amm term also include types amms also ' even discovered yet guess ' right 
367217,"after reading amm papers megabrain team chitraevansangeris last year ' come opposite conclusion amms simply "" passive "" amms hold latent potential space arbs part necessary ecosystem moreover symbiotic relationship two organisms has yet fully understood explored price discovery obvious first order effect relationship which hints something far complex coming future perhaps amms appear passive today ' awaiting innovation unlock "
367216,"my hypothesis would passive tvl have dex pool higher vol given asset pair trading volume one might expect see capital kind ,, energy "" needed flow update dex compared cex markets "
367215, going back dashboard shared nt noticeable bumps volume s attributed ammsnnthat d suggest amms still have nt found use cases would drive significantly larger volume exchangesnmost prevalent use cases ve seen dapps part amm ecosystem liquidity guys do nt need super high volume trades nn wwwtheblockcodatadecentralizedfinancedexnoncustodial 
367214,yeah what ' interesting also think how staleness large tvl pools could potentially find interpreted market signal e lps remain passive accident laziness choice staleness pool gets whole different meaning one might consider deviation compared cex wrong sense cex dex 
367213,ahaha see point nownnassuming amms adjust price market arbitrage conclusions thenn1 amm volume course driven volume order booksn2 ratio amm volume dex would increase higher volume environment since right much less volume amms approx equal increase absolute volume much higher percentage increase total trading volume amms 
367212, think amms ' really contribute price discovery ' little bit point trying make earlier amm passive lps waiting arbitrageurs come adapt amm ' really taking active role price discovery arbitrageur ' pushing amm line thereby establish price discovery relates back question what might reason increasing trading volume dexs compared cexs where think one reason dex amms passive need arbitrageurs adjust new prices which entails trading volume order kind update dex ' amm state where amount trading volume needed do higher passive lp tvl have 
367211, adding slowness large tvl amms what game theory conclusions  ?  nnfor example pretend have 1 order book exchange where price discovery happens 2 amms 1 significantly larger tvl othernnwould market overall have incentives allow arbitrage happen low tvl amms therefore pricing larger arbitrage opourtunities larger tvl amm  ?  nnperhaps s easy comparing multiple frequency which arbitrage opputunities happen potential profit per arbitrage 
367210, hmmmmm mean token traded amms yes s really equivalent l2 data amm world yeah d have incorporate data streams god knows what sources how long takes maybe already exists speed price discovery would time incorporate l2 like data amms time orders executennif token also traded order book exchanges consensus order book where price discovery happens amms exist quick liquidity speed price discovery rate which happens order booksnnyou could argue amms aid price discovery would love see reseaech conduct one nt literature yet even d guess speed price discovery speed fastest amm trade bit slower order books moment though

367175, think another reason could except univ3 dexs based passive lping whereas cexs generally require active market making result cexs tend regularly adapt incorporate new pricing information virtue frequently updating orderbook even when ' trades happening whereas prices produced passive lp dexs less often updated lps passive except univ3 sense waiting arbitrageurs come push prices back line trading agains pool naturally prices tend lag behind when proactive lps actively market make passive lp dexs liquidity lower slippage result trading volume one would expect see larger trades needed update prices accordingly incorporate new pricing information illustrate consider extreme case where ' one cex active mms one passive lp dex infinite liquidity ' new pricing information clearly rather easy mms update prices have somewhat quickly reflected new orderbook state cex however prices dex require infinite trades update pool balances reflect new price attracting infinite trading volume

352685,depends goals project look pump price well that s why pospone launch idealbetter market conditions 
352684, since nt raising money valuation irrelevant 
352683, s super interesting point actually true uponly launch bottom 
352682,it better launch token bear market community green time instead red fudding 
352681,true have never done liquidity funds usually price amm positions like options nnthen essentially hedge buying another option see crab strategy opyn instance usually payoff negative when cumulate positive times especially when pool incentivized what mean long run farming opportunities should disappear tokens should accrue much value market starting realize 
352680,and clearly wasnt working competing alt l1s without ability brrrr

349409,no doubt broke kusama twice 
349408,"re apps kusama polkadot determined launch "" people ' chain "" others launch vc chain get volume tvl others use kusama launchpad polkadot project "

349400, sure how something essentially launched security two  ?  private presale rounds 30 founder allocation could ever achieve sufficient decentralization maybe m old school times have changed fair launched leaderless networks adhere original bitcoin ethos have become really scarce nowadays 
349399, must ve seen 10 variations since 2018 point 
349398, insert chain needs good wallet lots talented teams building really great projects matter time gains traction 
349397,yup need decent wallet improve ux lots talented teams building really intriguing projects matter time til gains good traction imo 
349396, m sure s true s production kusama canary network 200 referendums voted inout far polkadot far behind tech works tokens bridged things pretty stable needs users 
349395, excited prospects polkadot has offer do nt dare make judgment chain still nascent stage might see many attacks stress test future when chain starts take 
349394, however pass message back forth still need trust bridge even bridge atomic swap ways reduce needed trust ultimately s lot compromises make case 
349393,connext works similarly atomic swap think someone correct  ?  
349392, m surprised atomic swaps have yet replaced risky practice bridging s proven work quite years afaik litecoin first demonstrate 
349391, guess why many btc maxis hate concept wbtc ethereum 
349390,same goes crosschain bridges sure sufficiently trustless ones dont rely small set multisigners multipartycomputation should minimum bridge i d argue bridge using simple multisig inherently insecure 
349389, one main challenges interoperability indeed security said what good assets transferred across chains have inherently centralized validator base went typical 5 presale vc rounds launch  ?  nni d argue biggest hurdle interoperability necessarily make technically possible actually find two chains sufficiently decentralized security maintained 
349388,here good thread topic twittercomjoshkesslerstatus1526249114488524800  ?  s21 tfvvtfntrydrxfvdy4y6ig 
349387,one two reasons shared security yeah ability one chain understand message sent another completely unrelated chain pretty big deal like shared library subscribe indicate intention properly parse process specifc type message

362559,yeah thats ideological argument practical pov does matter given conditions met otherwise walk please dont see 
362558,dai basically becomes blackrockcontrolled asset  ?  
362557, tmelobsterschat362511 
362556,absolute worst case lose 500m best case tap something goes seriously wrong onchain side things plus generate yield 
362555,having realworld collateral still onchain overcollateralized does turn dai usdc 
362554, do think becomes real risk share onchain collateral drops beyond certain threshold 
362553,tbf fishing excuses u0001f937u200d 
362552,you asked differences similarities know what kind answer fishing  
362551, let confusion see collateralized stablecoins inferior product consider liquity quintessential overcollateralized stablecoin does nt mean think experimenting stablecoins should stopped whatever 
362550, well s definitely insight gained take different things itnnas understanding implications what re well answer tmelobsterschat362497 makes pretty clear difference m less willing give benefit doubt 
362549,gov stepped 
362548, twittercomdoveywanstatus1542446114388844544 
362547,you oppose what think what maker has past 2 years one interesting things follow claim nonsense fully understand implications doubt theres much insight gained meanwhile keep calm use liquity 
362546, dont have problem maker experimenting let s honest know what happening i ve never really fan maker anyone active ccr probably remembers largely due impressively elaborate gubernance do have problem selling lie they re decentralized anything certainly defi s biggest decentralized stablecoin 
362545,if end goal deploy immutable steady state solution could have done ages ago 
362544, what nikolai saying feel like ye 
362543,they decided run whole thing governance style result 
362542,yeah whats alternative  ?  basically abandon whole thing let run  ?  
362541,the reality maker realized there s scaling cap token collateralized singular asset that s what sai dai nnthe problem think solve adding ever exotic collateral mix selling decentralized censorship resistant least freeze button underneath covers 
362540, mean liquity have perfect solution ideology people choose should good let maker experiment route  ?  
362539, think people started thinking ahead thats where ambition came would like assume maker people neither stupid acting bad faith least core 
362538, matter overcollateralized censorship resistant stablecoin humans prodding tweaking parameters has certainly solved pristine solution possibly get liquitynnbut believe does nt mean believe liquity has solved problem scalable stablecoin 
362537,ironic considering behavior one underlying selling point algo stables trip attack 
362536, taking makers side principle dont think hard see theres real problem has solved 
362535, problem nt s slow s refuse settle adequate 
362534,what came first ever growing dai supply ambition expanding beyond onchain censorship resistant collateral 
362533,lol 
362532,too slow 
362531,liquity exists 
362530,you meme liquity day irrelevant terms scale scales would run issues 
362529, mean virtue signal want complicated issue solution apparent 
362528,same frax sernnbasically see dai has perfect pmf gon na use usdc avoid issue personal transfers lock risks usdc able freeze account dai ' nnthis real use case dai frax stables which basically wrappers usdc 
362527, agree extrapolate every growing dai supply might 
362526, already d using things wrapper 
362525,over time ones withstood critical condition 
362524,fuck alex 
362523,this strange how go trying create construct mechanism tames volatility seeking nonvolatile assets back supposed tamer  ?  
362522,yeah order must collateralized assets sufficiently liquidated shit hits fan sure whether btc eth serve function extreme conditions 
362521, nt dai supposed nonvolatile asset  ?  
362520, mean real problem many liquid non volatile assets space 
362519,soooon (tm) 
362518, still remember people replying it s temporary when said nigh unlikely ever get removed it s us treasuries lol wen commercial paper  ?  
362517,the perfect trojan 
362516,the amount usdc collateral bigger problem imho 
362515,sorry making weird simple words company needs funding palm oil busniess malaysia banks delaying process loan approval 
362514,it may decentralized stablecoin fiatcoin misdirection where freeze button lies  ?  
362513,at point does make sense stack infinite amounts collateral agree maker should maintain vast majority collateral liquid decentralized cypto assets keeps growing theres issue diversifying 
362512,these seem weird ser 
362511, point nt collateralization rate where collateral comes second one well truly irrelevant sure concerned s what collateral 
362510,why shock mate  ?  
362509,wait what  ?  
362508,could guide list blockchain based crowd funding projects ni know names n1 ampnetn2 labs groupnplease suggest 
362507,would dai collateralized anymore full 500m get lost  ?  
362506,over 80 dai s overcollateral series assets frozen single click onchain overcollateralized money cex onchain overfully collateralized 
362505,again question whether bonds treasury investment actually replace critical amount dai onchain collateral 
362504, dai still onchain overcollateralizednnthis time becomes entrenched ' practically literally usdc governance top 
362503, might well buy diamond ico behind smart contract owned swiss ag 
362502,if either change result understand concerns dont 
362501, ll preface saying already questionable construct when forced usdc surely ambiguities time 
362500,or  ?

362493,but much fun way 
362492,but instead asking ton leading questions could state position move 
362491,what meant assume people oppose treasury bond thing have different degrees concerns which boil decentralization concerns 
362489,no designed way controlled central parties 
362488,do believe degrees decentralization usdtusdcbusdetc  ?  
362487,probably comes various degrees decentralization concerns translate offchain way works onchain 
362486, m asking what think 
362485,tell 
362484,what do think people supposedly making conflation concerned  ?  
362483,is people conflating things discussion  ?  argument made somehow  ?  
362482,they sold 500m fiatcoin collateral deciding which treasury thingies buy 
362481,treasury lol 
362480,are actually investing collateral treasury  ?  eg would lead dai less 100 onchain collateralized  ?

362472,nothing subjective rwas ser they re voting invest us treasuries using fiatcoin collateral bad enough nail coffin it s intents purposes fiatcoin dishonest marketing

343015,aave critical vulnerability went unnoticed year missed multiple audits luckily security researcher reported responsibility collected bounty could have let complete protocol drain audits often bullshit 
343014,clearly still lot rinse repeat ecosystem need do 
343013,yeap seems pretty fcked situation theory market should balance new auditor firms should come lot prices times could taken dev eng could get 10x making token whatevs whats incentive midtier auditing firm 
343012,there ux benefits token transfer triggering contract pattern has never really caught defi devs especially newer ones often ' recognize reentrancy risks 
343011, mean m blaming teams go cheap audits pointing realities finding auditors current market 
343010,the great auditors ignore cloutless booked 500 years projects clout course do it s said great business -- projects look great portfolio also pay nice fees should come surprise cheap auditors chosen 
343009, agreed complicated aspect could apply service needs carry insurance liability reasons medicine least us decent perfect analogy physicians carry malpractice insurance do nt think means re practicing medicine though 
343008,perhaps earlier comment settling cheap audits problematic 
343007,well yeah kind have limited resources get two audit requests anon team another aave know which one better business well which one least likely get hacked 
343006,time set clout dao funnel everything 
343005,weird way phrase though 
343004,ah clout huh 
343003, means wo nt speak nobody 
343002, want audit projects think have reasonable chance getting hacked nnwhat does even mean  ?  
343001,or helping bridge huge gap 
342999,yeap reason why auditor market broken basically demands incentives completely align least yet c4 strives good middle ground imho 
342998, s auditing tho  ?  s insurance s different mine field 
342997,getting real audit increasingly difficult scrutiny good firms dont want deal anons want audit projects think have reasonable chance getting hacked top long wait times insane rates mean protocols go real auditnnso yeah get what pay people should realize audits worth 
342996, toughest part retail users want audits do nt have big budget rubber stamp idk maybe better try inform community side 
342995,yeap do knowing rubber stamp question misleading inform have audits  ?  
342993,if go rubber stamp audit get rubber stamp audit 
342992,ah able execute contest yet does seem pretty timeconsuming generate report right  ?  
342991, definitely ca nt complain audit quality choose certain cheap auditors 
342990, know audit find everything s impossible why bug bounties exist 
342989, c4 also great confirm super demanding team s tech side 
342988,one pretty trivial skipped lost complete respect also vulnerabilities report clearly automated tool human doublechecked 
342987,that ' smth bad audits one has found smth audit covers everything unless mistakes mistakes trivial ye ' sign

342951,bean paid 500k audit  ?  
342950, whether adding liability would cause 10x s debatable ca nt charge what nobody willing pay s why wo nt happen -- s enough demand willing pay current rates s incentive anything change 
342949,already costs much though depending clout auditor see bean figures 
342948,emm hacken isnt bad seems lol 
342947, mmmm nothing entices builder flippant braggadocious auditing firm laughing fellow builders m definitely going use peckshield future really value professionalism

342940,did peckshield provide inputhelp finding issue back when guys hacked getting audited  ?  
342939,the auditing space fundamentally broken static code checks 1 million dollars year please nnah think ' expensive nnsuck sunshine everybody else charging shit buidlers

342919, know 1 experience terrible 
342918, bit aggressive sir do nt think concept holding people whose negligencepoor work accountable outlandish concept s certainly outside crypto plenty damages have irl negligence inspectors like answer might seem obvious re looking inside protocol building getting audits s obvious would nt work end 
342917,so u fan pessimistic  ?  checking 
342916,can plebs stop suggesting security practices like ' first time happened  ?  ' literally retarded sorry rude like every time hackexploit genius starts suggesting holding auditing firms accountable auditor deposits contracts making certik memes etc 
342915, want cynical value audit stamp produces revenue without security secondary since exploit 612 months road does nt matter ve already cashed chunk profits 
342914, yeah think correct market does nt seem learning lesson firms like peckshield 
342913, auditing firms wo nt pay 3 premium 100m tvl per year protocol 
342912, one cares see nxm s revenue 
342911,yeah misspoke meant auditing firms 
342909, protocols should nt buy insurance issue users concerned should ones buying insurance 
342908,audit market market auditor customer demand far exceeds supply everywhere queues several months advance curb demand many auditors prepare code test software solutions unfortunately fall far short human eye non hand still unscrupulous customers want cut dough soon possible instead making good product 
342907,yh thats what sherlock does 
342906, fair point costtime increases think realistically auditing firms would have purchase insurance do nt know what market like assume bad expensive 
342905, think adequate approach could include insurance pool audit process 
342904,so lossloss projects auditors 
342903, well s 10x m referring hehe 
342902,ive exact situation 
342901,ahahaha uniquely qualified say wouldnt pay 500k 
342900,would seed stage protocol pay 500k 1m audit  ?  when raised 15m 
342899, does nt solve anything rather makes extra difficult thing execute have downside issue arises time future 
342898,but think service still desirable maybe every auditor should do think would good 
342897,because comment 
342896,making auditors liable would put 10x premium audit prices would 10x slower 
342895, particular reason think projects should nt negotiate sort arrangement  ?  seems like helps align incentives properly 
342894, nah auditors should nt liable people should specifically know which auditing firms do nt give fuck reputation avoid even represents product launching 6 months due queues firms 
342893,lmao 
342892,agreed overall there s lot talks auditing world moving status quo here s pdf invoice good luck

366702,the big difference part inflation usually tokens staked where get apy annual inflation witch without new users creates sell wall nfts inflated new buyers 
366699,somehow agree economics part erc20erc721 technical specifications standards may have end result have erc20 max supply 10k make non transferable play have erc721 minted millions have real difference practical terms erc20 what meant relevant part economic dynamics how do plan healthy incentive mechanism incentivize coordination multiple parties different interests one single goal dump neighbour techs mere tools what matters essence game dynamic

366422,regarding alpha i ve observed quite time interesting phenomenon which logical think nnwe publishing alpha calls several times incoming dumps marketnthe mix onchain social data analyticsnnyet almost one seemed care much even went angrynnafter market crashed analyses get appreciationnsome bought subscriptions wellnnyet real alpha when leave market seems somewhat little discussed even addressednnmost participatants keep looking alpha understanding what when buy which imo totally wrong nninteresting human psychology

366417, think fair point things need transparent things should nt nnie smart contract verify looking looking code see s going operate expect critical nnbut does nt mean balance should public participate crypto markets 
366416, lem post something interesting peacenn tcowhr2236jf4 
366382,one point note though privacy oftentimes used synonymously intransparency privacy enhanced tech blockchains adopting showing us seems common misconception which also led lot larger corporates jump bandwagon aping idea private blockchains thinking privacy established reintroducing opaque closed systems 
366363,exactly 100 key privacy protects gains stance self adjudication what others see mission critical adversarial markets 
366356,yeah renaissance has consistently bringing 66 annualised returns 30 years basically have done incredible job leaking info outsiders 
366348,3ac leaded market lts ok long lead push price alone 69k without support problem start when market leads 
366345,even it s alpha it s trade secrets right  ?  how charge mgmt performance fee when people copy trade everything do  ?  
366344,so like battle isnt hard when have element privacy nni also dont buy isnt alpha there s people lead market nnie renaissance technologies alpha shop long ass time tradfi nansen thing back day would dudes have made gains  ?  think

366338, usually trade binance people l know minority trades ftx except bull market barely trade definni use nansen especially execute strategies essential 
366337,maybe have mechanism preventing liquidation hunt  
366336, s real problem ecosystem what re nnthe shelf life creative alpha short defi 
366335,the real question how add size dox alpha chain analytics firms plying sophisticated analysis nnanyone size anyone good strats getting rekt nansen 
366334,at crypto right enough liq even top traders how add funds without enough volume wise risk management 
366333, think l one traders nbeing followed public creates great security concerns nnwe sometimes share strategies profit honest l wont use gcr ' short list make anons make couple thousands nnand trading journey turn selfish long profitness increase get afraid strategies copied stolen 
366332,well high certainty trade signal really ' have incentive share would expect marke information get incorporated market prices regardless telling everyone however ' incentive share pseudo trade signals ' motivation get folks ape turn trade signal self fulfilling prophecy

359207,now lping everywhere leads il kek 
359206,they keep trying 
359205, loose sketch apologies ' misremembering sequence 
359204,bancor v2 turned massively gameable launched bancor v21 which turned massively dilutive launched bancor v3 which turned out... 
359203, feel like year bancor comes feature claiming have done impossible weeks later announces feature has shut turned impossible 
359202,yeah never used v2 v3 looked bit better never expected 115 weeks opening gates pull rug 
359201,we walked could run u0001f972nnbut yeah that s also true it s something needs change think something has pressure community cant future finance shit hits fan everyone goes lol tough shit 
359200,and yeah tried solve circular rectangle crypto indeed try make things 
359199, always felt good true almost obviously 
359198,bancor always risky 
359197, least say s even pmf multisig keys controlling everything place forever 
359196, have even really experienced crypto have nt gone complete 0 atleast  ?  tbh agree mismatch what dev expects users aware what actually aware does nt help loudest influencers have idea beyond superficial stuff do nt want discuss stuff wo nt pump bags 
359195, depends vertical well see reason ca nt have 1294837 mildly successful lending protocols survive years have winner takes view dexes 
359194,yeap seems completely fair 
359193, re much yet 
359192,imo competitor protocol vertical has emerged clear winner 
359191,eh completeness see liquity 
359190, think s partially marketing partially devs expecting everyone people know things do guess exclusive either see sentiment though getting rekt kind rite passage times marketing types ve encountered barely able explain understand risks s entirely founders recognize push users better educated 
359189,when devs stop something  ?  
359188,when declare protocol obsolete  ?  im deeply triggered il pause 
359187,well part problem marketing sole focus growth costs means turn blind eye when have users comes system without ever fully understanding what participating 
359186,which another problem kinda reveals crypto there s lot winknod dyor clearly messaging lostnnalso there s lot honour system play give ppl ability do shit dont want do someone gon na do 
359185, ve working experimental pool types hope have simulationsactual data show soon nice see market pushing innovative products extreme 
359184,nobody complains impermanent loss making limit order insert cex 
359183,lol bancor tg people accusing team leveraged trading liquidity have understand what risk even managing 
359182, course s lot finagling do when market good sorta works andre tried d say bancor especially paired dex thorough attempt sure why certain people kept claiming never mentioned certain things andor tried redefine funny terms when everything pretty laid nnbut does nt work re trying solve leg broken car when problem nt cars break legs have legs let car leg 
359181,reeeeee mods 
359179, problem nt risk s people managing risk effectively enough 
359177, believe equilibrium point which lp would accept risk il behalf lps wish have exposure il terms agreement underlying yield enough cases compensate potential losses considering swap yields right should result competitive rates sides 
359176,it s really risk problem it s even problem it s people trying eat cake have want able profit providing liquidity lose nothing liquidity used liquidity 
359175, solve wrong word s like saying solving smart contract exploit risk depeg risk etc insurance possible s solution option somewhat mitigate risk side possibly gain offering cover 
359173,if want solve impermanent loss get rid liquidity provision puts lps business  
359172,the bancor death spiral came sooner expected 
359171,yup risk destroyed transformed 
359170,at best risk transferred another user premium innovative ways solve something plan writing implementing soon 
359169, well why nt migrate everyone v3 remember bunch hype around

359164,damn everyone blames mercenary liquidity hostile antagonist coordinated whale attack

363252,tbh have idea what point i m saying projects first let retail close muh toxicity failed do due diligence what get using excuse exit isnt problem first since 2022 
363251, um ahem maybe curse experience agree s rational think single project where true one 
363250, why even have decentralized financial system instead what has already working centuries  ?  point people need manage greed gambling point entering new system s reasonable expectation make acquainted new rules instead expecting everything ultimately do nt want greed gambling restricted others do nt know how manage 
363249,people generally dicks internet where risk punched face non existent 
363248,yes it s safe say expecting people change unreasonable accurate we re expecting people change there s expectation people behave civily already do day day lives 
363247,nobody arguing token holders cant get expect get rich sure why insinuate anyone isnnthe people arguing anyone shouldnt get rich coincidentally retail comment matter noteworthy 
363246,less anonymity less risk probably makes difference 
363245,this really valid point imo however harsh reality raising public money always come public accountability positive negative 
363244, mean worked bank upon time beyond irate customers sometimes shitty behaviours dont ever recall receiving end level nonsense say didnt happen nowhere near level happens crypto i m sure argument has weight people have demonstrated capable controlling it s weird whatever reason seems get pass crypto like haha that s crypto 
363243,no claiming anything also trying get argument highlighting ' rational assumption token holders also users lot smart teams know exactly how utilise tokens bootstrap user base 
363242, expecting people behave like have centuries always unreasonable crypto nt magically going fix greed gambling 
363241, expect crypto different traditional finance gatekeeping invest project does nt match expectation instead expecting people take responsibility what buying reasonable imo instead telling devs use private funding 
363240, save network tokens where almost everyone user virtue needing pay gas fees claiming s dapp where mere token holders do nt outnumber users least 51  ?  
363239,this strange what would count sufficient data  ?  
363238,safe conclude wen numbah go devs dicks community entitled dicks numbah go devs hero ' community geniuses 
363237, s meaningless okay 
363236, clarified what meant get  ?  
363235,first define raising money retail absurd bought token dex expect get rich you re attacking something nobody arguing 
363234,bull tokens go tokens good nbear tokens go tokens bad why do things even need token anyways 
363233,why arguing strawmen  ?  
363232,yeah retail shouldnt expect get rich devs shouldnt expect retail behave informed rational way nnvery simply put 
363231,without accurate data ' claim otherwise what claiming token holders usually have vested interest also users dapp user also translate buying vision dapp project 
363230, s friction misplaced expectations 
363229, s almost sides people act predictable ways 
363228,yes fully agree 
363227, reason people launch tokens want make money s always upside creator intend take money general public have deal 
363226, mean make argument side ca nt handle risk volatility early stage projects should nt buy 
363225,you want claim even 50 token holders dapp users  ?  
363224,this strawman ser 
363223, basic point create expectations kind profit potential let everyone participate opportunity re going deal stuff ca nt handle keep private 
363222,the idea making money takes away anything funny case point 
363221, mean satoshi made lot money does nt sell does nt mean ai nt rich 
363220,not necessarily 
363219, m claiming s satoshi 
363218,community devs entitled wana build distractions accountability justified ' take public money 
363217,there chasm user token holder 
363216, do nt really want dive andre situation s satoshi made quite bit money even constantly larping opposite 
363215,community users well token holders extent funders experimental innovative products ... balance community devs needed bad behaviour exists sides spectrum 
363214, oh s euphemism 100 
363213, wish could say re right unfortunately s case people claw faces tiny bit power feel comfortable enough consistently bite heels money unfortunately amplifies problem 
363212,he didnt raise money satoshi raised money randoms willingly bought btc chose run nodes floor raising money bought token dex thinking i d get rich conversation absurd 
363211, honestly retail term does nt make sense should clueless investor 
363210,so zhu 
363209, 20 risk free apy  ?  m 
363208, s dubious redefinition terms 
363207, consider what andre also raising money retail context does nt matter whether do intially let join later exit liquidity 
363206,whether raise money retail outcome virtually identical 
363205,this preaching choir tbh project communities mostly filled degens moon dust mission people think investing crypto essentially sureshot lottery 
363204, re wrong 
363203, s point do nt get issue do nt raise directly indirectly retail s emotional responses people clearly fit make investment decision 
363202,consider fact screenshot essentially paraphrase andre s comment didnt raise money anyone nn community bullshit theory follows someone has token best interest do whatever increase value token how naive guess partly fault defi community calling governance tokens people want do govern trenches helping fight instead throne dictator simply shouting orders plebian developers need execute ' care protocol ' care would soon sell token when longer think contributing enough standards ' try add value happy spending endless hours time asking updates explain detail thought processes endless back forth pointless menial topics governance community kill innovation development ' do 
363201, re ones entitled crying tg either s moot point bring

363198,whether collected money socalled retail entitlement 
363197, sorry nt mean address project s raise bull suddenly close when stuff gets toxic 
363195,another thing lack domain knowledge expecting aaa game within year two starting development lack awareness retail has idea what early development product looks like hence piles unrealistic demand teams deliver something price pump 
363194, would noteworthy behavior peculiar projects raised money randoms internet nt 
363193,nobody surprised i m sure where think anyone actually people vent receiving end toxic behaviour sometimes bit empathy simple damn sux enough 
363192, argue regulators have different agenda claim s truth idea average person nt able make informed rational decision when comes investments s either kind stuff re discussing would nt happen know unpopular take ca nt have ways 
363191, sure saying s fully fault retail either s incompatiblilty general retail outside crypto hears project has survived s initial days where s reasonable expectation successful bringing expectation crypto unrealistic 
363190, do understand constant surprised reaction around something s known ages internet easy place toxic money brings worst people 
363189, argue people should nt behave certain ways fully agree people always like

362170,can anyone explain how loans work  ?  
362169,preach 
362168,if do told everybody need manipulate illiquid shitcoin pair shitty chain force price downup counts what exchanges report 
362167,doesn ' really solve issue ' adding manipulation vector 
362166,no exchange we gives native usdc harmony pricing 
362165,you ' really differentiate native chain price expect using onchain values nthen ' prone manipulations lot onchain pricing prone towards nnone solution implement another check bridged assets where oracle reports locked supply eg eth matches circulating supply eg harmony 
362164,that would hugely problematic lower liquidity chains cause whole slew even worse issues 
362163,so basically pulling data cexes add 50 weight native dex chain native usdc use 
362162,would easier check chainlink well local amm use lower two prices borrowing  ?  
362161,either implement specific weight price coming x chain chain something else 
362160, stop using chainlink push report correctly chain s data 
362158,potential solution could check another oracle checks peg eth locked assets native chain locked assets nnif peg breaks operations allowed nnjust spitballing def really interesting worth tackling tbh

362030,because lowlevel change bricks least one valuestorage system isnt exactly good look particularly when none done desire exploit anything - increase security 
362029,in case perhaps should consider changes behavior create2 well 
362028, nt point sendall allow siphoning residual value  ?  
362027,last checked design pretty much finalized discussed allcoredevs 
362026, far know eip still draft seems like people want things change does nt appear foregone conclusion 
362025, dont think true give promise understandble things have change 
362024,except sload gas tweaked one time brick someone 
362023, certainly do nt think anyone used system assumption evm might make changes made value inaccessible 
362022,perhaps should do away apparent farce immutable contracts knows what unexpectedness needing hardfork discover future eh  ?  
362021, fair assumption methods allowed value stored accessed would nt change feet 
362020, somehow re applying frontier opcodegas rules today u0001f937u200d 
362019, pattern challenges fabric immutability user s pov though  ?  
362018,lol 
362017, ethereum never gave promise evm wo nt ever change 
362016,funny stuff 
362015,on supposedly immutable platform building what should immutable contracts  ?  
362014, yeah designed acceptable paradigm chain s looking like evm wants pull rug nanyways firmly opposed eip people s money stake ca nt change rules game implemented poor design begin people followed design 
362013,you getting bricked relevant either 
362012,intention irrelevant 
362011, create2selfdestruct never intended pattern fact abuse hole design should nt prevent closing said hole 
362010,this almost equivalent permanently locking liquidity uniswap v1 when rage left dead v2 v2 getting rekt v3 though fortunately v3 didnt go expected department almost it s worse 
362009,even auditors have started recommending selfdestructing clone pattern how secure 
362008,exactly why bad eip 
362007,not get rugged something implemented designed 
362006, nt upgradeable system good code designed immutable possible 
362005, would nt able implement check avoid redeploy somewhere else  ?  
362004,because contract never deployed onchain blocks dramatically reduce gas expenditures incurred single transaction 
362003,holes like create2selfdestruct prevent consensus radically raising gas limit 
362002,you using faulty metric performance must measured gas proportional gas limit 
362001, applications affected change use breaks where contract recreated address using create2 selfdestruct 
362000,says exactly eip 
361999,if contract already exists address selfdestruct has bricked create2 reverts iirc 
361997,process quite simple predict new contract location using create2 determinism send tokens contract address contract exploit when ready withdraw deploy contract address retreive tokens call selfdestruct save gas 
361996, do understand please explain how eip bricks alot money  ?  
361995,but gas made measure want save real money costs makes sense simplify nodes remove dubious opcodes raise gas limit 
361994,create2 reverts contract already exists 
361993,its blow meta transactions though 
361992,how does brick alot money  ?  according eip sendall still used retrieve funds 
361991,it ' less gas intensive far safer paradigm value storage currently accepted practices 
361990,good luck forking away 
361989,create2selfdestruct clear abuse hole ethereum design closed 
361988,hard fork bricks lots money ' popular hard fork u0001f937u200d 
361987,benefit whom  ?  
361986,the important question do needs production environment outweigh needs many good sir  ?  
361985,would like see ever implemented production environment uses create2selfdestruct loops heavily sandbox value storage ' see actually implemented knowledge benefits former practice spread 
361984,probably verkle trees state implemented  ?  
361983,when eip getting implemented though 
361981, eipsethereumorgeipseip4758 
361980,or usdd oh wait taken oh wait nobody care 
361979,or rather prevent redeploying address 
361978,which would break metamorphic smart contracts

361955,"assuming wallet mean "" create new account "" option within metamask makes "" wallets "" share seed one compromised short answer yes "

361844,yeah reported thought clipboard virus given everyone else replicate well it s clearly

361838,no clue bro linking cn etherscan assuming ur china sure how chrome ext work wall 
361837, tokens would one thing s clearly software bug tons ppl have replicated 
361836, could why does metamask add prefix re sending eth re sending weth 
361835,not prefixing probably tries see ens name 
361834,this 
361833, have nt looked anything else 
361832, specifically usdc usdt weth does nt do 
361831, why would nt do tokens 
361830,sending eth adds 0x 
361829, still reason make random wallet address does nt explain why happens certain tokens others s weird overall 
361828,0x prefix indicate number hexadecimal rather base ethereum addresses hexadecimal 
361827,weird 
361826,each 64 character address goes one specific random wallet address 
361825, desktop version makes random address s where tx goes 
361824,it used add 0x needed try metamask mobile says invalid address something like 
361823,yeah 
361822,so sent adress without 0x went random one  ?  
361821, re copy pasting address could get screwed 
361820,certain exchanges show without 0x 
361819,seems like unusual scenario  ?  
361818,metamask used add 0x automatically 
361817,why would people send transactions without 0x  ?  
361816, yeah s example try wallet address 
361815,that address empty tho 
361814,not sure why longer adds 0x says invalid address something seriously wrong 
361813,it would send funds instead what entered etherscancomaddress0x00000020ca5ca4f9236e618f7c3a8bd45b59eb45 
361812, do nt click submit take look final wallet metamask would send tokens lmk does nt match what pasted

361809,initiate transaction random wallet address without 0x start should 64 characters instead 66

346387, hey guys anyone knows api yields  ?  know vfat working version might take time s publicnnthe solution see scratch data manually wanted know something easier work 
346386,as said have see actual code know whether particular way better worse 
346385, suppose have written words realized talking revert likely case checking bunch things true one nt revert case think re right short circuiting leads us revert which point cares whether wasted gas ands 
346384,if would benefit short circuiting should end 
346383,the case which save anything operands already loaded really sequence ands final check value 
346382, ve saved nothing 
346381,because compiler should generate code goes false exit else b false exit else b c false exit else revert 
346380, fact re wasting instructions lay like 
346379,if b c false still need jumpi 
346378, b false do nt need do c s jumpi 
346377,simple example 3 operands b c 
346376, ca nt together one instruction though 
346375, think even case nonreverts big require should still cheaper jumpi costs 10 gas costs 3 gas like said specific example needed 
346374,yeah people gon na look ust say algosbad bad may could hardly design better trojan horse fiatcoins various glorified wrappers somehow top 10 3 
346373, well yes change come quickly unexpectedly current paradigm has help 80 years does nt mean change extremely rapidly right would cause lot instability though 
346372, reasonable branch prediction have started speculatively executing based assumption require sanity check revert should nt even really lose cachepipeline except exceptional case which point already going spend bunch extra resources processing revert 
346371, another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto nnwe ll dead true beyond shillfluencer narratives even doesnt happen bigger things worry should happen 
346370, s code re jumping which has nonzero cost terms size cache locality afaik jump instructions do cost differing amounts gas based absolute value program counter incrementdecrement 
346369, condition evaluates false do nt execute expensive revert logic including string return etc 
346368, s syntactic sugar condition revert reason 
346367,right happens side branch instruction 
346366,honestly ' need exact code figure thing besides actual revert instruction ' also returning error string logic which far expensive booleans evaluations 
346365, makes sense yet time s odd thing attempt re trying hedge away risk systems dollar side inflation cefi systems issue government instability crypto side instability crypto systems continues issue one perspective crypto extremely volatile relative usd another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto eventually line crossed where people see usd volatile relative crypto likely onchain assets primary reference point point ve suddenly gone optimizing cryptobased risk needing optimize fiatbased risk s really difficult balancing act strike properly

369020, when said nothing change mean like underlying mechanism how achieve stability altered well contracts how macro outlooks merge well possibility pow fork affect m sure debate do agree tho yes s quite likely assets pow fork chain become worthless esp since exchanges nt willing prepped accept assets 
369019,even could get something nothing 
369018,yeah true unless started similar pricing gave time lusd redemptions collateral value backing would get smoker 
369017,the question pow eth would valued 23 pos eth how much would lusd worth pow network 23 cents  ?  
369016,no oracle support pow fork bet 
369015,hmm wonder ' worth holding lusd similar stables going merge hopes fork

369008, impression s 110 ethnbut stand corrected 
369007,yes 
369006,is lusd 100 eth backed  ?  think last checked 
369005,only stablecoins could work chains simultaneously would 100 eth backed stablecoins imo course would need functioning oracle

368959,on current wallet generate addresses use seedphrase 
368958,not sure understand  ?  
368957,bip39 tool make sure save page run offline better

368911,personally instead selling mac ' keep offline crypto module buy new one personal 
368910,if u delete disk utility startup screen do fresh install reinstall ' difference nnthen should safe 
368909,ayo kek 
368908,most time seed already encrypted applicationlevel filevault adds another layer delete volume good 
368905,there applications which write zeros memory erase content deleting files usually ' actually delete changes small part memory which tells os ' file ' 100 fool proof regions memory get worn time ' get written basically preserve what therennafter selling machine might well treat private key compromised moving assets new address would likely best

344245,and whats alternative ml model case would  ?  probability describes confidence forecast case llama believe easier use sort model describe relationships variables rather manually handcraft estimates something using model case provides scalability generalization 
344242,exactly why think crazy teams set high apy distributions early days launch give majority supply handful degens prepared take risk have little likelihood sticking around long term 
344241, i m saying it s unpredictable ml model redundant imho defining probabilities 51 94 doesnt make much sense 
344240,the reason simple risk goes time apy goes 
344239,and literally generalisation financial signals large number participants involved easy prove true empirically look defi launch 
344238, almost every crypto participant also able tell usually when product launches apy high high risk untested lot people do nt want risk time goes product doesnt get hacked apy goes downnnthis simple prediction yet proves possible predict apy stability 
344237, tbh do nt get why people find strange actually really easy tell naively whether apy drop example when aave launched polygon easy tell 2030 apy would nt last long since trusted platform battle tested sure enough lasted daysnnyou apply logic masterchef pools launch see spike apy drops predicting things like quite easy do nt see why should issue train model

341220, what s point yearn abandon ownership 
341219, s blanket statement ca nt apply every protocol 
341218,abandoning ownership best 
341217, reasonable level decentralization 
341216,granted think multisig far better halfbaked governance abandoning ownership even better

341070,it ' apples apples criticism

341065," 2 yeah true "" omnichain "" assets well trustroot compromised tokens get inflated  "

369956,and even needed something like 80 stake power online

369954,seems like 
369953, docssolanacomclusterleaderrotation leaderschedulegenerationalgorithm 
369952,it possible indeed how should which where decentralized network gets weight thing actually happens solana  ?  
369950,so failed transactions might result solana network congestion classic 
369949, lol s website also 
369948, said ca nt find evidence deliberately censoring txes validator chat solana discord seems mentioning entity spamming network purportedly prevent attacker moving funds we 
369947,so thing would still possible noncensoring validator include tx 
369946,lmao 
369945,back when blocked candy machine txes temporarily iptables rule dropped packets candy machine account 
369944, several security firms

369928, think main difference solana validators better coordinated -- quite sitting solana discord 
369927,yeah hard believe 2k validators agreed already across time zones 
369926,maybe  ?  apparently 2k validators though stake power probably concentrated larger validators 
369925,does validator exist  ?  
369924, suspect noncensoring solana validator produces block within 2min attacker sending transaction actually sees transaction tx go anyway 
369923,regardless imagine much theoretically possible game quite simply 
369921, mean way actually invalidates tx 
369920, would miners choosing include txs would nt change anything consensus 
369919,from ct thread issue seems like wallets phantom slope mobile solana network 
369918,no  ?  why would 
369917, would nt attempting equivalent what led etc  ?

369915,never dull day crypto 
369914, s possible malware npm packages solana dependencies js have worst ive used 
369913, nt eth hashrate also similarly concentrated enough small number mining pools blacklist like work  ?  s nondurable  ?  solana transactions become invalid re included quickly enough eth transactions practically valid perpetuity noncensoring miner eventually include tx

351433,more like true do something forces hand people actually control token it s dead water reason cant get rid zuck 
351432,this fully agree protocols where team basically denies governance allowing snapshot votes happen 
351431,works practice when have onchain gov hiring funding everything 
351430,true idealistic theory naive practice 
351429,this why always say snapshot voting ' governance core team becomes gatekeepers ownership taken holders 
351428,eg maker governance has successfully executed facilitator offboarding proposals fired people onchain votes 
351427,imo token holders owners asset relationship made protocol core team whole operation hire team 
351426, i m sure anything healthy come relationship unless extremely selective let hold token hook crook have concentrate hands you re familiar mkr wasis infamously concentrated token bested eos time 
351425,this applies debtbacked stablecoin providers 
351424,sure what happens dai grows even every dai existence maker continuously earns interest 
351423,hence maker never pumped  
351422,it ' bad value accrual method still profitable asset really one hold mkr btw 
351421,yet ' almost always example good working product almost value accrual 
351420,depends whether project state where has grown sufficiently grow healthily accruing value holders 
351419,imo maker case crypto 0 dilution continuous buyback burns 
351418,to really profitable protocol should accrue value holders dilutes 
351417,because mc share therefore revenue share constantly diluted 
351416,that aside isnt make money i m holding token behavior source problems space  ?  
351415,just clear revenue distribution ' profit asset deflating higher rate 
351414,whats best protocol right terms revenue distribution  ?  curve  ?  compound  ?  
351413,general sentiment powerful within short timeframes long term speculation almost always fundamentals 
351412,lol suppose lawyers eventually have day 
351411,you got example  ?  aside maybe btceth dump less pump htf 
351410,not disregard many crypto projects securities whether admit 
351409,even still makes revenue crypto general sentiment much powerful hence overall market need purge crap 
351408, basically asset continuously making money holders nnheh blatant disregard howey

351406,nfa 
351405,basically asset continuously making money holders point pe ratio floor dividends bring mc 
351404,instead ' asset steadly growing revenue potential profit years ' have time entriesexits 
351403,that ' assuming pumps ultimate goal pumps useless ' almost always followed dump have somehow time entries exits right 
351402, well nt refer crypto years market ca nt say im expert know something crypto high beta risk assets which scarce hence pumps hardest psychology market applies best possible way crypto like early dot com bubble stonks hence still have psychological model euphoria fear working 
351401,not saying one way speculation better obviously profitable best would argue ' lot easier speculate profitably based objective measurable facts data long term 
351400,fed macro factors still fundamentals since asset ' holding ' companyproject working vacuum 
351399,it ' speculation ' question what speculated speculating future revenue based fundamentals therefore dividend growthdecline  ?  speculating twitter shills betterworse job bringing greater fools asset  ?

351373,high risk high reward good vc needs return 3x capital invested many unprofitable long term angels well recent times many likely profitable due overinflated paper valuations ya longer term p500 much safer bet

351371, despite hand wringing rich s understanding vc firms lose money average yeah super high risk 
351370,wework losing billions year even scandal still managed raise like 15 billions private funding recently looking articulate raised around 15 billion 80 million revenue 
351369, early stage startups get 20m valuations ca nt exit reason valuation may make sense have 10 chance becoming worth 1b 50x return investment highly profitable ofc real numbers different might 01 chance bet does nt make sense s ev 
351368,then differences need explained 
351367, s important resist conflating businesses different stages which have different players involved different incentives 
351366,just true though nthere bets like magicleap extreme exceptions market has flowing cash past years saying 70b valuation uber made sensenbut overall non web3 businesses pretty easy understand 
351365,of course 
351364, eventual profitability important s how businesses valued short term speculation has impact long term does nt hold water revenue metrics business extremely important looking numbers outside provides little insight amount profit company generate next 20 years 
351363, companies have raised billions last years investors do nt have significant amount revenue justify probably except epic does nt even have sustainable revenue model 
351362,there certain irony watching discussion starts disagreeing what essentially there s equation profitability circle back less conclusion digress

351358, s really relevant anything want look regular businesses how operate do 
351357, mean turn around s good far 35b invested extra 500m isnt crazy amounts what crazy how company could raise much sort product market fit highly unusual point company has invested billions r 8 years effort

351350,the vast majority profitable  ?  
351349,amazon wasnt proftiable like 20 years chose many companies something basically public companies have common good revenue likely could profitable wanted vast majority

339989,guess definitively answers tmelobsterschat339965 docs recommend 5 validators subnet going 10 methinks isnt going end well 
339988,you re right though case it s one exploit significant really crypto s significant case though arent much new without marketing clout 
339987, finding one exploit does nt say much company auditors s consistency researcher found exploit guy working day day audits  ?  na good hunter always good chef 
339986,the old post response gavin woods criticism subnet security model according thread nn subnets subset larger universe validators subnet s security independent larger network nnso would think yes answer question trouble finding information avalanche docs dont go security implications risks

339966,malicious subnet validators ' currently penalized main net 
339965, ca nt find anything uh validator stakes main chain affected activity subnet  ?  would random subnet t1000 validators colluding insert whatever penalized main chain  ?  
339964, validators ll interesting see outcome 
339963,so subnet validators must also validate avax chain avax validators validate given subnet 
339962,scaling comes small amount validators specific subnet performance should pretty high subnets centralised 
339961,if every avalanche subnet validator must validate main chain  ?  where scaling coming  ?

339815,yes think 
339814, good speech determined current fads 
339813,so code freedom speech rule have big 
339812,ok growing weed 
339811,its probably tell regulatory boomers look comply holy sanction list really silly think shows point someone really does get how stuff works 
339810, also oracle pretty much useless pretty sure chainalysis knows what s idea  ?  v2 script relayers track transfers  ?  
339809, may practical every project one way when s nothing strongarm compliance everything else less solves 
339808,having things depend single maintainer could part solution work should also set way allowing churn protect people leaving when things become heated everyone has different perception risks nothing preventing ideas proliferating 
339807,and why keep mentioning liquity 
339806,the protection absolutely anonymous software immutable decentralized possible running sort central twitter account already problematic imho tricky topic basically communication do online matter how small open window identified 
339805,unfortunately need fight protect maintainers eg wwwcoincenterorgnewcryptosanctionsbilltargetspublishingcodefacilitatingtransactions 
339804,so maintainer basically have absolutely anonymous extent where law enforcement track thats tricky days gets tricky every day 
339803,it easy order able do maintainers need protected otherwise go doubt tornado people aligns vision product 
339802, s easy do nt integrate narcware products do nt have backdoors which abused 
339801,then should clear rebuilding regulations way tolerates products like tornado whole goal get control people recall meaningful reversal regulations opposite direction lets reopen conversation tends become spammy 
339800, funnily sanctions oracle operated eoa d think twice relying itn etherscanioaddress0xdf900dc8991474ab9d69f2c3b9c900c055fb36cd 
339799,not kowtowing weird frankenstein monster 
339798, actually... ' see way avoid regulations currently 
339797,you assuming structures charge regulation acting good faith 
339796,the best way solve problem make irrelevant 
339795,nor supporters privacy censorship resistant platforms imho 
339794, mean best way solve problem actually rebuild regulations makes sense provide proof funds whoever asks put jail ' do let ' leave discussions 
339793,yeh least long ago wh something like 2030 tx coming directly coinbase  
339792, yes s exactly what ronin bridge exploiters right blacklisted address transfer eth addresses use tornado 
339791,well use dont need 
339790,people send tokens exchanges darknets 
339789, d surprised 
339788,people unironically okay stuff users tornado makes sense 
339787,yeah ' good long regulators okay way tornado currently one use freely 
339786,aaaaaand tmelobsterschat339781 case point why people unironically okay 
339785,window dressing 
339784,they do provide services regulator compliant though docstornadocashtornadocashclassiccompliancetool 
339783,thats why move kind odd does do anything everyone involved should aware do without canceling whole thing 
339782,it definition regulator compliant does thing regulators handle obfuscation funds 
339781, think tornado should stay regulator complaint though otherwise addresses interacted tornado would banned cexes thus leaving almost easy way stay anonymous still have ability cash money internet cash 
339780, should ve gotten rid inperson leverage ahead 
339779,but generally agree imho much organizational structure behind tornado already makes vulnerable kind stuff best deployed anonymously immutable 
339778,disgusting what absolutely terrible standard set 
339777,that would form whitelisting basically render whole point tornado obsolete 
339776,seemingly small give inch take mile what s next  ?  relayers start running script verifies you re good sufficiently kyc d somewhere  ?  maybe relayers have taken already a la tor  ?  hyperbole maybe 
339775,yes there s problem model changes good deposits 
339774,lf contract immutable anymore way blacklist hacks etc 
339773,not forkworthy also forking something like tornado hurts privacy original forks users model depends many deposits different entities possible 
339772,wen fork  ?  soon  ?  
339771, kind measures have impact ca nt people transfer assets non blacklisted address use anyway  ?  long blacklists recursivetreelike updated absolute realtime which possible wo nt make difference

363599, agree perfect what though use qortal without sponsored sponsorship entitles minting rewards 
363598, malicious people set should nt hard mount sybil attack which what think meant when mentioned selfsponsorship 
363597,its refferal system 
363596,yeah gives secret society vibe 
363595,because based screenshot stuff moving opposite direction decentralized 
363594,isnt bigger problem need sponsored  ?  
363593,also rewards progressively lower time eventually voted network 
363592,right host simple websites network concept proven work 
363591,p2p 
363590,the point qortal amass money though create decentralized internet 
363589,there issue self sponsorship which addressing right 
363588,you mint when get sponsored already existing member 
363586, think someone like alchemyinfura doubt re mining re running lot nodes

363583,the tech works dont focus much opticsmarketing 
363582,its wiki 
363581,this seems pretty hand wavey nn qortalorg nnlacks clear description how ' consensus works 
363580,whats point running node  ?  ' definition og btc whitepaper  ?  
363579,again running node running validator btc has high bar entry mining node 
363578, have solid tech built like fully onchain decentralized chat neat features 
363577,and ones have solid model equal participation network everyone 
363576,there qortal know 
363575,maybe mina  ?  
363574,for validation bitcoin otherwise ' intractable problem participate consensus economies scale always tend towards centralisation work start wants solve ie one cpu vote using asymmetric aes encoding research shows ' probably pointless 5 years someone would come asic defeat

363566,any project which actually has core value  ?  anyone participate without amassing hardware  ?  
363565,it would trivial expensive set baseline arbitrarily high fit even solana well answer different question 
363564, well go article ll see actually cares minimum viability run node 
363563,fair still think ' m00t ' like running probabilistic model feasibility transactions fees sustaining bitcoin network when mining rewards end least eth trying do something acknowledges problem 
363562,far reasonable 999999 bitcoin maxi figureheads 
363561, worse performance requires higher hardware costs which prices users able attain sovereign security model enabled running node nnhis intent pretty clear 
363560, feel like ' kicking tires know eth has massive storage requirements instructions say anyways found bsc one interesting time completed 20 something gb wonder what 
363559, do seem remember puzzled how eth though d have check 
363558, know bitcoiners would nt call bad faith lopp starts baseline assumption able run node should easy enough anyone do basic consumer hardware something common circles benchmarks least see simply seeing what conforms 
363557, funny read icp 
363556, still think ' done bad faith

363554, think s still useful tbh never really know how requirementsrecommendations made sometimes things work even far what s listed requirement 
363553,"such silly report "" requires 3 tb going run 750 mb case "" "
363552,also blogloppnet2021altcoinnodesynctests want get snapshot time answer what costs run node

348568,how blz gearbox apply credit  ?  
348567,as rwl truefi lending amo goldfinch amo passed governance have deployed come next 2 weeks well 
348566,no around corner fraxlend which got done audited trail bits past monday projects have already reaching us apply credit 
348565,we probably introduce risk metrics based big unlocks could impact protocol stability 
348564,keep mind big portion liquidity locked 
348563, rwlprotocol credit loans has already implemented 
348562,you see appfraxfinance 
348561,8875 cr moment 
348560,sorry u answered earlier 
348559,wats cr atm  ?  
348558, think asked answered does nt seem like cr 100 proposal pass ll keep current system place intended algorithmic supply backed fxs rwlprotocol credit loans still seigniorage component safer models 
348557, mentioned earlier another chatnnfrax community built ogs space made money make money rather solve real problems definnsecurity risks always handsnnwe have seen how community ogs backing hacks happened tribe fuse poolsnni have nt seen single vcs influencer offering anything ust luna holders yet 
348556, saw connect rwa how regulation cr ratio 100 how fxs value accrual frax minting 
348555, fxs liquidity place think 09 approx ' fall ' buyer tbh given usdt ' depeg real which likely wo nt 
348554,can give us numbers breakdown balance sheet  ?  non one hand have 15b frax value nwhat numbers side  ?  
348552,1nas read recently twitter nothing would love hear simple explanation honestly 
348551, samkazemian blz get printer ready ser  
348550,this also issue faced central banks generally fiat money difference backed army ntheir model also unsustainble takes longer break apart 
348549, samkazemian imaginationnnwhat would happened frax would replace 3pool colateral 4pool colateral weeks ust died  ?  cr would going 0  ?  fraximalists lucky ust die 4 pool launch  ?  
348548, correct s enough pol satisfy outstanding frax entirely safe circulating supply earning good yield right obviously do nt want say 100 safe due possible smart contract risks andor tether depegging which unforeseen events assuming steady state things rock solid 
348546,damn like stuff why lp fk me... anyway ask sam print stablez gearbox pools soooooon  blz ser 
348545,to extra sure 
348544,but gap algorithmicity exactly what recent proposals sam wan na fix make durable 
348543,since like 80 literally stables via curve lp correct wrong ' fall 
348542,curve falling depegging hard underlying collateral 
348541, read 100 msgs let s talk spaces tonight 
348540,or what take break 
348539,this actually should regulate inflation fxs stake holdersnnnot sure where standing 
348538,so frax also broken  ?   
348537,yes amazing frax still made 35m week 
348536,indeed 
348534, everything collapsed hey still generating millions s bottom sky limit products solutions introduced 
348533,this means frax generating weeks billions 
348532,and another product introduced ecosystem generate profits protocol 
348530,hard assets like usdc deployed curve pool technically 3crv lp tokens specific lending amos also known overcollateralized loans pol uniswap amos etc 
348529,but cr ratio becomes 100 how fxs token accrual value frax demand  ?  
348528,acquired profits what frax product generating 
348527, think main question arw trying understand what backing 1484b supply godefi right  ?  
348526, ya re right front end does clearly show 1485b frax dashboard appfraxfinance 
348524, blogtimelessficompostspytpricing2 zeframl big pp 
348523,the current fpi cr indeed 100 right 
348522,fpi 100 cr new peg totally different stablecoin balance sheet should 100 cr like frax started should even conservative opinion fpi peg even harder keep dollar peg since pegged cpi thus inflation resistant 
348521,correct  
348520,the 12b total supply frax little confusing show agree profits accumulated balance sheet 40m correctly pointed 
348519,115 annualized case 4o accrued far guessing 
348518, samkazemian fpi partial algoritmic  ?  new model cr 100  ?  
348516,if like tradfi lingo yes think that s somewhat accurate think accurate say traditional fractional reserve bank where illiquid debt fxs backing algorithmic supply frax aka liabilities bank 
348515,we money market product when increasing cr ratio right  ?  
348514,yes profits held investor amos like vlcvx places yes treasury msig controlled fxs governance votes 
348513, btw profits nt 12b think mean frax supply 12b profits always 200m sitting around 115m which lot technically lower 
348512,and lunaust made curve wars ended 
348511,ya frax still 37m positive earnings week which amazingnnq when profits fall half 12b what happened frax supply how  ?  nnig multisig fully controls profits fund 
348510,tokenomic design ... 
348508,not sure might directional market depth 
348507,nice coincidentally going thru frax fei docs 
348506,usually 2 ' sure 
348505,in coingecko api what do mean  ?  nncosttomovedownusdncosttomoveupusdnnmove how much  ?  
348504, have nt done analysis protocol profits since last week assume frax still one cash flow generating protocols entire defi space even lower 200m revenue yields do nt think s many protocols match frax s revenue generation which weird see fxs hit hard market rn see dashboard average daily income protocol 317kday s 115m annual revenue conditions extremely good shape excelling even markets 
348503, farms frax apr restake apy otherwise auto compounded rewards  ?  nni ask tokens farms ca nt easily claim rewards users ca nt usually hold tokens afaik nnrebase like ohm one option auto compound curious how frax might do 
348502,you also find breakdowns dune dashboardn dunecomsebafrax 
348501, think way governance proposal written confused people going full 100 cr since done community member s important know nt changing fractional algo model making safer keeping things essentially backed debtcredit 
348500,yes bottom right profits still balance sheet see breakdown where profits top left investor amo 
348499,cool pol bottom right chart  ?  
348498,we count lending amo cr 100 cr rather 150 cr correct way think frax minted places like aave backed 1 debt owed aave protocol 150 eth borrower used borrow frax 
348497,thanks sam helps lot 
348496, another example lending amos which similar dai s direct deposit module do count cr overcollateralized maker does 
348495,every amo has extremely conservative way calculating cr which see look source code onchain since open source frax does 0 market operations chain deterministic 
348494,the pol page yes example cr calculated much conservative manner cr curve amo calculated claims 3crv collateral protocol has frax peg breaks cr which means curve pool gets emptied frax 88 nnin reality curve amo close 1 1 redemption frax sellers frax amo rebalances actually withstand 1 1 sell offs entire supply 3crv 
348492,ah misread bad ser thx 
348491, exactly think got intepretted seigniorage capture fxs totally new stablecoin really case re trying improve model make something algostables aspire do s important know frax has pretty much perfect peg since launch do nt want get complacent think endgame design forever re trying improve design algorithmic part supply additionally backed debt 
348490,ah majority amoa stays credit cr ratio let ' say 10  ?  
348489, wouldnt say radically think people really took mean frax changing everything which true making even safer still actually sustainable algorithmic supply frax frax right close 90 backed hard assets enough pol which isnt counted cr cover outstanding frax redemptions thing wanted add proposing algorithmic supply backed creditdebt addition fxs

341840,especially latter 
341839, like bonding curve parametrized becoming dense stablecoin stabilizes 
341838,teach man fish etc 
341837,what do like experiment  ?  
341836,no 
341835,can summarizeelaborate why  ?  
341834,balancer does 
341833,he could have used stableswap invariant really wanted figure pretty nice experiment must say 
341832,curve uniswap have aesthetic distinct 
341831,codebase isnt everything 
341830,try saddle finance 
341829,well mean 
341828,maybe work fork curve uniswap 
341827,heh 
341826,embrace extend extinguish 
341825,seems better many volatile pairs which supported 
341824,idk think andre wanted experiment bit 
341823,curve has advantage defined market stables opposed every token ever uniswap 
341821,brahma finance 
341820,led zeppelin  ?  
341819, does curve have oss code basic ui runtest s 3 pool contracts  ?  
341818,well number coins stableswap invariant 
341817, what s curve 3 stable pool mathalgo boil  ?  
341816,heh 
341815,solidly basev1pair contract literally goes like nnif pool stablen use x3yy3xnotherwisen use xynnand stable flag set pool creation 
341814,for stablecoin pools solidly uses special formula which has adjustable parameters has infinite liquidity density middle think 
341813,does solidly alter uni code formula fork curve pools code  ?  
341812,the feedback loop fees dao emissions users 
341811,not lock 
341810,what part protects moat well 4y lock  ?  convex sort translated 16 week lock 
341809,but clones alternatives expected token economics curve something which protects moat rather intellectual property things whatever 
341808,balancer implements stablecoin algo stablecoin pools 
341807,curve crypto pools v2 eg tricrypto crveth 
341806, crypto pools also performing somewhat better  ?  nnyou mean curve pools what crypto  ?  
341805,advantage uniswap ui well marketed fairly big when uniswap2 usdtusdc pool making quite good apy even constantproduct invariant consistently getting traders rekt 
341804,uniswap has competitive advantage wellknown ui people go which routes uniswap pools case when marketing works balancer ui has unusable back day good guess nncurve has competitive advantage well spinned sustainable governancesubsidy system which pupm important pool earlier stableswap crypto pools also performing somewhat better constantproduct alike 
341803, why nt balancer well many basic uniswap v2 dex s either  ?  s superset less slippage  ?  
341802,higher slippage traders always prefer curv 
341801, why nt balancer nearly successful curve tho seems superset functionality curve  ?  
341800, what would have involved adding 3 pools  ?  hard do  ?  wondering why nt included 
341799,to add current solidly implementation afaik impossible pool deployer immutable 
341797,how hard add 3 pool relatively speaking available pools support  ?  
341796,solidly stable pools uses curve kx3yy3x otherwise kxy bitoken pools 
341795,yea taking position vol basically 
341794,does solidly support curve 3 token pools  ?  
341793, internet computer canisters reminds bit holochain s dna zomes bit icp way user developer friendly tho 
341792,such brain much wow 
341791,yes 
341790,or volatility time 
341789,theoretically hedge options delta perfectly continuously realized vol implied vol when options purchased u would break even 
341788,dynamic hedging delta hedging spot moves 
341787, what re building rysk uses options primarily also use perps spot manage delta could say yield comes harvesting volatility gamma depending how want look reason reply guys dont think volatility mispriced lol something alabeda making markets ultra efficient  ?  time decay where delta comes pool prices incentivise purchase derivatives move delta back 0 whilst pool aims delta 0 dream delta option changes which why hedge needs dynamic why say uncorrelated instead delta neutral unlike basis trading which static hedge 
341786,basis trading defi primarily based carrying equal amount spot perp contracts aim delta assets cancelling theyre delta 1 1 aim should ur collecting perp funding rate basically risk free theres need rebalance except managing ur margin portfolio delta spot futures dont changenas mgavaudan attest basis trading doesnt scale well defi protocol unfortunately do chain perp rate arbitrage even could hard sort pvp twittercomcryptonoodlesstatus1514942117243666433  ?  towjth6nupthrtdscnaokq s19 nin tradfi think basis trading could options idk sure what ive seen basis trading derivative defi typically defines everything differently would say basis trading first definition defi 
341784,whereas rysk strat built options 
341783,so taking direction perp earn funding hedging spot put simple terms possible 
341782,well lemmas part know strategy primarily options based rather perps based 
341781,ser do believe try precisely deploy delta neutral strategy basis trading difference call dynamic hedging sounds looks like basis trading dumb ass tbh dynamic delta hedging options trading strategy aims reduce directional risk associated price movements underlying asset done selling purchasing options underlying asset purchasing amount underlying asset options even futures ensure delta portfolio 0 investor aims reach delta neutral state docs there s nobody team da house  ?  would could could post explainer difference mgavaudan could explain difference smol brains like myself 
341780,probably market way around everything lol 
341779,you have wonder viable

341527, think circling back yicalex s point tradeoffs 
341526,ofc higher technical learning curve downloading running locally back start 
341525,but one run ipfs pinner 
341524,right initial pinner still liable afaik 
341523,someone needs host though something ipfs doesnt offer anything itselfnnyou either do which case dont need think hard how shutdownnnor let cloudflare do which case see abovennor ethlimo which says lot without saying anything reading links medium content privacy policy tos certainly quite interesting 
341522, hmm s where browsers like brave services like ethlink comes guarantees still exist way access abstracted away s perfect ofcourse introduces points failure still way average user access site 
341521, wrap way s digestible average user make sure s slow fuck re good go way see people like already easily run access decentralized frontends s what matters product like uniswap 
341520, hmm frontend available ipfs achieves flow similar effect have hash s guaranteed point files look see hash one updated onchain txt record ens controlled contract onchain governance

341508,sure mean terms reaching existing social system tech top 
341507, hmm s valid point dao considered legal entity instead community case website frontend truly decentralised 
341506, which why asked it s dao does hold water

372367, isnt nnno isnt why think well carry feel free search grifter you re interestednnas lusd vs fiatcoin wrappers yes dont like either when wrappers try sell something they re tangible benefit fiatcoin wrapping should have one manner liquity without pretendao games 
372366,it s quote tweet defending chainlink relianceimmutability isnt which part earlier pretendao fiatcoin wrapper conversation  case actually have nothing lusd anything do like lot dont like people pointing fair critiques frax dai ignoring fair ones smaller stablecoins that s  
372365, mean definitely label d use s one simply referencing argument week ago 
372363, lol might want read post re replying think m calling grifter 
372362,you might want check what word grifter means dictionary means smallscale swindling seeing how lusd barely 12 2 size frax dai respectively one side looks like grifter might want default calling everything else scam next everyone least knows true colors

372343, well definitely nt scaling exact mechanism nonstop has shrunk time s probably yettobeinvented mechanism possibly 
372342, true far evidence points overcollateralizedonly model what going do might unique innovation new stability mechanism fully decentralized scale billions onchain entirely far evidence does show yet does nt appear overcollatonly model 
372341,again why do think doubling lie answer question  ?  
372340, ve regurgitated point 3 times 
372339,the question whether scale what has happened far ' scale till do 
372338,just something ' happened yet ' mean ' 
372337," ' literally reiterating bit drama what liquity presented oracle summit nn "" better aligns values "" n "" decentralised backstop "" nnthey ' fully aware entire construct relies centralized entity setup even when switched backup continuously try default chainlink ' available nnit ' preferred choice fully hands cl instead using project "" better aligned values "" obviously ' gon na meme still go centralized one reasons pretty damn obvious nnthe moment cl "" gone "" liquity gon na do everything power fork ' why ' farce "
372336,but years ago dexs never gon na make either 
372335, s many reasons volatility eth need know every stablecoin built overcollateralized asset model fraction fraction either dai frax s mcap coincidence should take real world data heart clearly illustrating point lusdfeisusdrai combined do nt even reach 800m market cap although love individual unique innovations something learn teams world class incredibly small re trying build stablecoin ants simply going grow past certain size using models crypto does have evidence single overcollateralizedonly stablecoin grows size rather shrinks time 
372334,no frank think real challenge decentralized stablecoins does appear actual way scale without taking real world custody aka fiatcoin risk mentioned yesterday let forward what wrote 
372333,as whether would actually go 0 torn still well 0 
372332,is glib slap tellor supposed serious grasping straws make point  ?  
372331,so would say biggest risk decentralized stables may oracles  ?  nncan create purely chain dataset 1  ?  eth stable eth wbtc swap values allow us derive value 1 rough draft how system could work nncould cut price feeds chain sources create immutable chain unit accounting where data sets always derive values  ?  
372330,not sure why think doubling lie answer question 
372329,"because ' bit farce justify immutable contracts nnsimply deploying immutable contract centralized oracle project goes nature "" decentralised stablecoin "" slap tellor lulz decentralisation part even though never used entire tvl omega nuke chainlink ever stops serving nnstop pretend game pls "
372328, what does have do pretending re exclusively dependent chainlink  ?  
372327,because know project goes 0 dependancy gone 
372326, why do keep writing like re exclusively dependent chainlink  ?  
372325,at least maker votes people deploying unit makes oracles possible 
372324,"kek honestly nnanything using glorified multisig calling decentralised farce kinda goes "" defi "" "

372318,might well do also let usdc holders vote right  ?   
372317,after governance add 
372316,might want consider giving link holders tangible governance powers votes 
372315,does make fiatcoin wrapper dependent 2 daos  ?  
372314, re right link governance token cl msig signers 
372313,they would branded lqty governance token good attempt 
372312, cool guess different flavors pretendao s different people suppose remind lusd fans least brand pretendao like us omit fiatcoin wrapper part sure 
372311,but disingenuity par course 
372310,the entirety argument muddy waters claiming we re since use chainlink s oracles we re better way get blacklisted chainlink pretendao do something when reality possible fix problem liquity chainlink dependency completely irrelevant simply go straight dao point moot best 
372309, re right s even worse ca nt even change chainlink pretendao pretendao process 
372307,unstoppable long chainlink allows  
372306,you ' find buried le docs tho 
372301, ethcollateralized stablecoin uses chainlink s oracles nonexclusively different fiatcoin wrappers actual pretendaos also dependent oracles 
372299,so does lusd chainlink pretendao 
372298,they best fiatcoin wrappers 
372297,both claim decentralized stablecoins 
372296, sure what re talking literally go appfraxfinance daistatscom get real time transparent view how much frax dai fiat wrapped took 20 minutes arguing admit lusd chainlink pretendao should call even guess  ?  
372295, tmelobsterschat372228 
372294,it ' never pretended hammering stablecoin practically via proxy full control chainlink also semi nice 
372293,yep that s basically what i m saying effect lusd like pretendao like call pretendao chainlink rather something else 
372292, ya what m saying 
372291,sure idea absence pretendao liquity solves anything farce 
372290, re claiming governance would solve hypothetical problem governance propose has failure state 
372289, dont understand what you re saying thing i m pointing lusd immutable cant even change oracle way hardfork new token addresssystem contract bad everyone must already implicitely trust chainlink oracle keep serving liquity holding lusd 
372288,last 60 days polygon single address fulfilled requests nnalso let ' kid moment chainlink would blacklist everybody would stop using lusd 
372287, ca nt put smart contract jail either how useful  ?  nnwhat stops tokenholders voting dead address new oracle  ?  
372286, ca nt put dao jail mean actual msig signers something oracle setting should onchain tokenholder vote like governorbravo type contract since critical stablecoin system like lusd makerdao s oracles actually well done terms how need updated 
372285,that admittedly problem past last time checked reduced possible time updates accuracy well dependent amount people updates watching network 
372284,you simply ask dao brick end jail wan na see how many people willing risk freedom online voting game  ?  
372283,if pretendao would need go chainlink 
372282, k cool still does nt change fact lusd fake dao would entirely rekt chainlink updated contracts remove great point guess 
372281, s what practice 
372280,wtf pretendao  ?  like derogatory way saying fake dao  ?  
372279, reason need jump hoop going chainlink impervious direct attack frax makerdao nt vulnerable also pretendao risk 
372278,you re thinking what you re proposing attack you re proposing lusd would completely unnecessary pretendao would simply need go said pretendao 
372277, report price accurately often tellor does nt do either least past 
372276,so long someone willing report price should continue work 
372274,agreed 100 protocol has certain strengths value propositions though none perfect 
372273, depends unlike chainlink tellor nt permissioned 
372268, s kind moot lusd liquidity multiples dai frax s go large scale solution ham stringed immutability plus mind crypto anything ever changing 
372266,what mim 
372265, think important thing understand tradeoffs people saying lusd impervious things dai frax weak quite right daifrax impervious lot things simple fixes us would rek lusd force redeploy everything basically dead 
372264,oracles issue plagues solidity chainlink center point failure code oracle source ever screwed go should pull basket oracle feeds self twap value 
372263, requires goverance s way someone have release contracts update front end 
372262,do redeploy upgradable oracles  ?  redeploy immutable contracts  ?  nnif nr2 would use ' gon na migrate new version everytime face oracle troubles  ?  
372261, why change governance instead  ?  s point should governable s stablecoin s like s uniswap base layer consensus contracts anything 
372260,but changed thing better change course hit iceberg see coming 
372259,yep precisely would 
372258, does nt work ve integrated lusd protocol every single thing stack would also need change 
372257,immutability meme window tho  
372256, ca nt create new contracts get ppl convert  ?  long way around usually works get ppl close positions time migrate mean someone deployed intial contracts right someone could deploy new ones 
372255,that would make sense something like uniswap amm basically tool needs nonchanging structure doesnt make sense anything trying stable value 
372254, totally which why ve always confused lusd holders bragging how literally nothing code ever changeable s forever immutable 
372253,as someone working oracles think ' actually building something oracles ' able adjust potential changes ' world trouble nntoo much change andor go wrong blind trust oracle project kinda insane 
372252, s view well 
372251, guess nt instant fair like said code continues report last price reported oracles should hopefully give enough time lusd holders sell everything have s late d assume peg would even volatile currently right s kind great outcome either 
372250,it seems like protocols aiming core primitives need upgradable entirely selfcontained 
372249,but could argued chainlink blacklists ' kinda 
372248, mean theoretically continue running long tellor reports prices none oracles report anymore use last known price forever 
372247, chainlink decides upgrade contracts lusd ca nt use nothing done s 
372246,nope none entirely immutable decentralized lqty has gov rights 
372245, yeah s great upgradable gov  ?  
372244,"think major issue ' trying peg anything first place nnwe either deal centralized entities issuing wrap shit 10 times centralized oracles making possible governance able attack ,, peg "" nnall which ' sound promising tbh ' compromises top compromises "
372242," mean ' dealing people have thought entire tc ,, ban "" point ' surprised shit like happening "
372241,at which point people maybe consider pegging something usd fiatcoin experiments 
372240,the delivery merely coincidental though anything circle asked blacklist uniswap facilitates illegal currency exchange which far likely 
372239,the issue has found reverted have approved contracts curve past hours please revoke immediately please use curveexchange propagation curvefi reverts normalnnthe contract needs revoked 0x9eb5f8e83359bb5013f3d8eee60bdce5654e8881 have approved please revoke immediately revokecash 
372238," mean... could argued nah  ?  nin essence ' enabling creation decentralised stable ' talking lusd attacked kinda means reason right  ?  what prevents circle forced blacklist uniswap pools deliver price reference data allows ,, illegal decentralised stablecoins "" build  ?  "
372237, m worried total immutability lusd contracts chainlink stops serving lusd right possible lusd holders lqty holders greater community do anything s basically 
372236, course getting pricing data does nt rise level sanction 
372234,and governance also attack vector  
372233,then ' gon na using tellor indefinitely ' gon na get exponentially risky people gon na look exit prolly 
372232,if thing governance could do you d have point considering governance could sanctioned brick it s dubious 
372231,"that ' viable solution kinda moment depend people price data ' kinda gg nnbut even what uniswap pair do use ,, peg ""  ?  nncan ' use ethusdt ethusdc  ?   "
372230, chainlink blacklists lusd due sanctions nt even worse contracts immutable changeable lqty holders governance  ?  kind governance would easy switch twap oracle permabricks lusd 
372229, shame hindsight do nt use onchain oracle v3 nt exactly exist time u0001f937u200d 
372228, s really one group sells fiatcoin wrapper something s pretty straightforward dependencies 
372227,what could cause tellor fail  ?  
372225,"you kinda have win ,, legal battle "" able literally blacklist entire smart contracts  "
372224,meh shit really nndoesn ' really matter circle forced blacklist chainlink forced upgrade sanction everybody using tellor smart contract right  ?  nnthey ' pretty much shown ' willing do either things last couple days 
372223,but better pretend game maker frax 
372222,if fails tellor kicks fails well dies should 
372221,stated ' using tellor backup 
372220, lusd nt exclusively dependent chainlink 
372219,lusd ' since ' immutable 
372218,yeah point elsewhere

372215,doesnt rai use chainlink well  ?

372210,kinda why think rai lusd 
372209,yeah fully aware saying ' living cause chainlink allows nit ' another centralized entity forced act certain way tho 
372208,tellor alone reliable source liquity would dry scenario 
372207,well yes should have said excluding chainlink frax lusd seem like would take immense lockdown blockchain shut however 
372206,"it ' using tellor backup contracts immutable nnwe ' also seen first smart contract ,, ban "" what ' say lusd oracle supplying data ' getting flagged future  "
372205, s why ppl say careful chainlink fwiw 
372204, well m correcting take does indeed require trust chainlink signers oracle lusd uses

360625,there fruit phone iphone samsung bkk everybody elsenn wwwcounterpointresearchcomglobalsmartphonerevenuehitsrecord450billion2021applecaptureshighestevershareq42021 
360624,if selling point new phone brand allows connect brockshane directly yet vague definition directly isnt covered how phones work today well hope have lot money keep manufacturers alive 
360622, think involves separating tpg rpi tbh when sum comes wo nt even able calculate native psus 
360621, kind nnit s 3 minutes cut thread heren------------------------------ 
360620, nobody said os built scratch explicitly said s based android 
360619, cool s one approach go 4 whoever does m advocating reinventing wheel 
360618,so what native support  ?  replacing bios efi  ?  installing new tpm chip  ?  do need entirely new processor architectures  ?  
360617,you also know oses have module support enabling code loaded kernel which enables native support without writing entire new os  ?  
360616, tell re getting frustrated isis dis de wei make point have others have 
360615, 3 minutes lights out... 
360614,you know user code runs processor right  ?  has access hardware os  ?  
360613, i m clearly talking people know nothing software hardware oses everyone keeps saying support natively means anything 
360612,because support something natively build better optimized things without bunch hamfisting 
360611,ivan going ban say last time one has named single os feature would improve apps obviously do need custom os improve apps 
360610, do nt want see another software company pretend do hardware fail crypto crypto separate issue 
360609,features start 100 points must justify existence beyond 100 points 
360608,why do need os when dos 
360607,you use xpubkey calculate used addresses iirc 
360606,why 
360605,does anyone know valuation stepn raised  ?  
360604,why though 
360603, agree approach making phone 
360602, yes better crypto integration os level d neato 
360601,why make custom rom work hardware available  ?  
360600,decent os nnative implementation ngood hardware security nnstuff actually mattersnbrand name nmarket experience ncaptive audience nnhow much revenue do think samsung got  ?  
360599, reason do nt have cryptospecific many things 
360598,please finalize ur arguments has 130 messages haha sorry 3 
360597, why do nt have cryptospecific desktop oses  ?  mean should nt issues apply  ?  
360596, Ai Ya  do nt think re likely agree think ivangbi gon na get irritated circular arguments eventually lol 
360595,if os level support needed someone should able give example right  ?  
360593, re unhappy current crypto apps cool should make better app 
360592, right well have nt described anything needs os support improve 
360591, have said beginning arguing os app hardware per se 
360590,please post receipts 
360589, know least 
360588, re agreement app 
360587,do think people went buy samsung phones  ?  
360586, decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal nn developersamsungcomblockchainplatformoverviewhtml 
360585, would nice stopped pretending re breaking new ground nt something one recent history has done 
360584, yeah os nt problem apps 
360583, find exceptionally irritating experience 
360582,you must have different levels patience crypto apps phones 
360581,you havent actually mentioned anything phone could potentially useful beyond what current phones do well enough though there s part experience made better oslevel integration 
360580,not least hardware hard 
360579, m discussing what crypto native phone could potentially useful least view think solana wise going arena although have doubts ll able deliver 
360578,until we re making phone standard traditional organizational bullshit 
360577,so how put away breathless praise governance model announce something substantial produced  ?  
360576,we have limited information 
360575, do nt represent solana have idea what thing do lol 
360574,this uhhh maybe it ll better integration nfc support  ?  
360573, could argue whether needed pinch zoom whatever whether wanted hardware keyboard made actual claims what thing could do why d want 
360572,do think people went buy samsung phones  ?  
360571, fact quite obvious thing lived demo going change everything question whether would live demonnand yes people said nt need anyway surennbut do nt even have demo compelling features 
360570, decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equal nn developersamsungcomblockchainplatformoverviewhtml 
360569, solana phone nt changing world we s giving normies experienced obsessively documenting lives anew device which ll do chain 
360568, familiar particular topic s why s reminiscent days months heard type stuff people actually got experience phone 
360567, well fact s using android already makes conclusion fairly easy draw 
360566,okay bathroom browser demo  ?  
360565, cupertino dude 
360564,you clearly watch when presented 
360563, thing has anything really announced re crapping lol 
360562,it obvious demo 
360561, nt came 
360560,when last time watched product announcement  ?  
360559,it obvious how iphone browser differed featurephone browsers 
360558,something already possible argument development 
360557,think normies get minting useless nfts directly 
360556,it s like selling new brand hyping connection internet nn phone seriously connects internet faster phone 
360555,iphone example inaccurate using browsers phones years iphone iphone made easier more accessible key 
360554, watched thing live night shift 
360553, either shouting nt possible rim 
360552,he laid extremely compelling case why wanted iphone obvious anyone watching presentation world changed 
360551,worse people do buy phones order interact brockshane interaction simply one things do 
360550,like have seen 2007 presentation jobs gave  ?  
360549,how would possibly know ' even launched yet u0001f923 
360548, re reinventing anything whatever re supposed offer something already do 
360547, do nt s obviously parallelnnmp3 players enabled something nt possible optical media tons problems magnetic media mp3 players easy response question m asking carry entire album pocket go running without skipping do nt have rewind possible existing technnthe iphone first phone have browser actually worked touchscreen responsive enough navigate web pagennthis app 
360546, noise though asking genuine question seems like convo ve twenty years people entrenched systems 
360545,the 20 years ago comparisons dubious leap phones today whatever phone offering 
360544,of course 
360543, maybe argued have walkmen do nt need mp3 players have phones apps like weird one tmobile why do need apple app store  ?  
360542,this noise around when samsung offered sdk interact ethereum  ?  
360541, do nt see parallels  ?  
360540,yes 
360539,not even close true 
360538, do nt wan na ad hominem please do nt take way around adult when iphone first came when mp3 players came chance  ?  
360537,all arguments making applies pretty much every major innovation last 20 years 
360536, hard customize android os do tons things user does nt have do customization 
360535,what os level features do exist today need implemented work properly  ?  
360534, saying hardware bad idea either btw have nt thought s natural place have quick debate someone 
360533, s interesting s handwaving s app launches when hit nfc tag app controls experience 
360532, ve actually said defended needs hardware look back ve talked exclusively os native implementation 
360531,why  ?  why giving apps  ?  what benefit do get  ?  
360530,why earth would do  ?  
360529,doesn ' have certainly interesting approach might actually end good ux 
360528,sure could why  ?  metamask exists 
360527, maybe d movs next phone change  ?  
360526,right ' process via blockchain 
360525, have nt explained why needs hardware yet hard parts development users would get good experience developers have do hard work do nt need entire new device 
360524, do nt think do build os  ?  
360523,so exists solana user using iphone andor samsung idea dump devices  ?  
360522,hell could launch wallet app ios when tapped nfc tag 
360521,see earlier points already done bad argument it s headache do 
360520,those two sucked 
360519,name two 
360518, originally answering someone s question what does someone using solana daily get  ?  yeah 
360517,the use case ' excited able add addresses able use nft payment instore payment terminals like apple wallet instead running credit card system submits signs blockchain transaction saves merchant 3 credit card fees 
360516, 1 done today androidn2 requires browser support done current android devices 
360515,ability natively tap send money via solana chain friend next mennability use biometrics confirm tx native browser do yield farming 
360514,who target market  ?  solana users  ?  
360513,name two 
360512, idk what plan do could envisage number things native implementation would look like would make life easier m utilizing crypto day day basis 
360511,and why do need make hardware do  ?  
360510,you have said words concrete information what exactly would different app running os vs existing one  ?  
360509,what native implementation os  ?  
360508, point something possible like paying bill method headache like sending checks does nt mean gets done well when something easiernnso app go phones rn makes possible do crypto tx does nt get adoption could bc s headachennif decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equalnnergo good idea solana do probably useful general crypto adoption 
360507, think should simplify what phone do which mine cant  ?  why cant current do  ?  why worth much  ?  
360506,what does hardware need support current phones do  ?  
360505, remember re talking android have tons room screw around os features 
360504,can explain cheap seats what exactly gain dedicated phone task vs app launched phone 
360503,lol yeah literally point doesnt take 20 steps pay bill takes many steps deliberately name muscle movement step 
360502,the problem has less do flaws solana do selling phone 
360501,yeah feels like solana dumb therefore everything do has hated us 
360500, look rates repayment bills when do nt have send check instead use cc via websitennit s 1000 increase debt repaymentnnso kind make point yes 
360499,this thoughtful commentary havent provided single reason why phone which optimized way run blockchain client would better existing phone which run app including blockchain client 
360498, feel like kneejerk culture war replies rn thoughtful commentary tbh 
360497,oh come like meme where someone lists 20 steps necessary pay bill check including licking stamp putting stamp envelope separate steps open app phone does blockchain shit what should netflix button phone  ?  
360496, said s built android would obviously able do everything else 
360495,can do everything do current phone need carry 2 phones  ?  need another phone next project do 
360494, argument one sirin brockshane phones let s pretend s meaningful leap going 
360493, people use phones much making blockchain transactions one sad do nt have phone has native support making crypto tx 
360492,being able do tons headache vs able do easily natively what sets adoption vs obsolescence apart software 
360491,can ape phone do something current one  ?  have gated access app which apk would work elsewhere  ?  
360490,and still need pos support everyone go route 
360489, general purpose phone run whatever app want including nonshit wallet app 
360488,yeah does feel like 2008 tbh 
360487, re basically suggesting should move back feature phones 
360486, do nt get do phone wait actually ca nt solana nt functioning  
360485,blockchains host one application 
360484,this argument feels like someone explaining touch screen phones dumb feature phones fine  
360483,an os runs one application people already make phones oses which run applications why do need make phone run single app  ?  
360482,your phone does everything does apps already best thing changes backend which users could care less 
360481, nt os literally software attached piece hardware  ?  lol nonsensical critique 
360480,why do need produce entire tiny computer run single app  ?  
360479, wanted do tx say pos stephangoss mentioned p2p tx anything else would nt have jump fifty hoops do 
360478, s actually il bnt tanked could nt cover il turned il protection think 
360477,so where loss going  ?  why discreptancy  ?  
360476, s literally wallet software free phone attached  ?  
360475,what does mean  ?  
360474,native ability do crypto tx without really garbage third party apps hope 
360473, excellent question forget what phone offers people do nt use solana moment bought ecosystem fully what does do  ?  
360472,celsius withdrew 2000 ether bancor actually got 1200 making snark how permanent loss impermanent loss bancor still working designed 
360471,and solana decentralized  ?  
360470,what advantage do think phone offers people currently using solana  ?  
360469,that works centralized entities though built payment infrastructure circumvents entire traditional system ' excellent 
360468, one has take weird crypto token hell outside blockchain space even knows what sol  ?  works everyone nt even have build entire phone do 
360467,with what  ?  
360466, have s called crypto debit card attached apple pay 
360465,you shutdown solana directly phone dedicated button  
360464,abuilt hardware wallet integrates natively point sales systems real life payments would huge advantage 
360463, database starts working primary area expertise broken they re going add new completely different area endeavor think going have positive result  ?  
360462,eli5  ?  
360461,how phone competitive advantage blockchain space 
360460,it means database starts working have phone ' massie competitive advantage 
360459,lmao what does phone have do blockchain validates something traditionally organized orgs sure they ll do stupid things attempt bandwagon get publicity 
360458,its like samsung would launch diesel engine car display 
360457, what  ?  database nt even working launching phone what world mean

338872,ethically agree 
338871,auditors allow projects jump queues vcs allocations extra money shady reasons auditors they re criminals posing auditors 
338870,so question becomes do want raise money  ?  retail  ?  sure dump moment receive airdrop 
338869,however how different angels  ?  
338868,but honestly have rotten apples everywhere vcs which truly toxic detrimental vc reputation 
338867,kinda agree analogy

338864,anyone know good video editor available quick turn around  ?  
338863,is like how tether has negative reputation sense ahem virtuesignaling people talking keeps chugging along really talk  ?

338861,how certain  ?  
338860,yeah one wants vc audit instead hiring auditors vc firm makes sense establish partnership audit firm 
338859,this 
338858,we agree general vcs have negative reputation space competition increases crypto native vcs raising shit load capital web2tradfi institutions entering space higher strategic value add required demanded crypto projectsprotocols providing gtm support bd tokenomics introductionsnetwork becoming less strategic day vcs have keep boosting value add remain relevant space therefore offering tech support product testing feedback governance support audits crazy may think 
338857,it makes sense one biggest upfront expenses toughest squeeze connections lot new protocols 
338856, m gon na name which vc tell s happening 
338855,how vcs poaching hiring auditors top tier auditing firms establish internal auditing division team  ?  matter fact already happening within vc landscape it s strange would think 
338854,but case event people always point fingers least would want have internal audit team fault correct  ?  
338853,no vc want tangled sort attacks none parties liable 
338845,that causes huge conflict audit public instead internal use 
338844,actually second thought ' making good point smarter structure would vc firm do bulk deal someone like trail bits allow portfolio companies pick auditing time ' even matter expensive anymore ' basically impossible even get time vc firm guarantees access would have big leg getting cap table

338782,yeah idea makes sense basically non custodial staking tries address problem verify onchain do verification onchain whether someone moves assets therefore reliably distribute rewards based basically hook notifies staking contract when asset moved 
338781, yes s what d recommend however see angle guy coming
