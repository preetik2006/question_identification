352127,indeed best ones add rpc dont go blank page ur obscure chain 
352126,yeah horrible ux goes dapps say wrong network dont give option automatically add said chain mm expect user add rpc details manually beyond stupid 
352125,so perhaps problem metamask pop option immediately connect cuz imagine opposite took 5 extra clicks finally connect wallet uniswap ' screaming how horrible ux 
352123, recon dapps when open directly wants open mm window connect wallet annoying personally prefer when have choice connect directly clicking button etc 
352120, i m exactly sure what mean crypto friendly run blockchain nodes contabo works nicely 
352118,yeah point remains people do give private rounds enemies considering history particular message 
352109,isnt what vcs 
352100, guess should have researched polygon acquire lot stuff thanks xdai suffices example looking

358755,you obligated do reverse airdrops 
358749,hey guise do have one pager why someone would need lobsterdao nft ie what benefits 
358747,"not sure ' possible build "" decentralized "" nif 100 based smart contracts without chain logic anyone able frontrun bot ' tx attack itnnanother side anyone able build bot automated scripts u mentionednbut offchain logic nobody has access ' attack "
358746,is decentralised version crypto trading bot features like take profit stop loss trailing stop etc  ?  get yearn manage vaults like hedge fund likely using kind auto programmed trading strategies ' found standalone protocol which provides customizable trading bots 
358734,any service where see historical pricesfloors nft collections  ?  
358729, collateral eth debt token token b order liquidate provide token b receive eth discounted rate based oracle s valuation eth token b sure get flash loan token b pay loan have bunch eth owe amount token b have bunch ethnnhow do think re going get token b  ?  
358728,how do repay flashloan  ?  
358727,still want know case why folks worked liquidation lol 
358703, im terrible short term trader especially leverage alright recently what baffles anything why hell tron has nt driven ground 
358699,could shorts 
358685,it possible oracle ends saying price pos liquidatable chain price much better oracle liquidator going have wonderful time 
358684,aave safety pool deposits whatever name rekt enough printing aave holders rekt 
358683,yeah interesting how play price nukes 50 instantly 
358681,idk what said gaped 
358680,risk pieces within price oracle looking venues where people might have bids... ' easier have higher level would arbed potentially leven want across everywhere 
358679,should lower 888 choyna buying 
358672,but yeah do 20 enough get position 10 hf one liquidate anymore 
358667,you ' have liquidate 50 liquidate little want 
358666,where bite auction  ?  
358665,tbh depends does have liquidity absorb 35bil one day sell side alone  ?  consistent sell offs  ?  macro environment  ?  
358660,you ' have liquidate 
358659,it would have conceptually eth has billions liquidity still case please see msg 
358657,it went level seconds bots might have enough gap profit slippage anyway price bounced 888 bidders china saved 
358654,cexs already have exposure risk via direct defi participation 
358651,ofc u have investment arm 
358649,reason do interest 
358648,so what happened aave position get liquidated  ?  
358640,biggest leak letting others have opinions trades 
358636,well never know what happens behind scenes doubt tier1 exchanges degen money ways 
358635,why would exchange give fund 3ac  ?  
358634,we ' have last cycle 
358633,some may have gambled funds giving 3ac blcokfi example 
358631,needs have public leaderboard strategies seems end around 400k gdp 
358629,why  ?  real reasons  ?  gladly major exchanges went 12 cycles 
358627, would bet money binance fall  
358626, experience anything beyond 34 million cash starts create exponential less marginal utility per pound earnednnat level nice property comfortably stick money safer equities farmnnsure ca nt buy boat plane does nt matter much tbh 
358613,having becomes meaningless point losing never does 
358612,you keep gambling matter how much have 
358610,what lmao 
358609,it never does tho maybe become bet 
358605,do know ath net worth lmao 
358588,would hilarious repays 
358579,how long does take liquidation happen  ?  
358572,this dashboard daistatscom collateral shows 60 usdc usdp which guess bit betternnnot sure which dashboard correct why much difference 
358556, s pvp season actually always has when incoming liquidity bountiful people really bought wagmi koolaid 
358551, m sure luminary has something figured printing money probably dude wrote code liqudations m going compete  
358547,essentially have access capital generally form stable currency without sell assets 
358546,idk ct filled shill people writing threads threads best days everyone else circle jerking how smart 
358543,if u got dollar name outtraded 3ac 
358540,that would findom stuff 
358538,not like get boner when net worth dropped 0 one day 
358536, have nothing better watch 
358531,same reason why people remortgage houses buy nice cars 
358529, oh hey what s 
358528, guess could phrase simply nnwhat s point decentralized lending like aave since need deposit get  ?   bugs 
358523, what happens stability pool empty when liquidations occur  ?  nnif stability pool empty system uses secondary liquidation mechanism called redistribution case system redistributes debt collateral liquidated troves existing troves redistribution debt collateral done proportion recipient trove s collateral amountnn docsliquityorgfaqstabilitypoolandliquidations 
358520,stab pool empty what  ?  
358519,what  ?  
358513,why pay debts eth already  ?  
358511,dont think people borrow eth pay debts do crazy stuff 
358507,if past 2 months have taught us anything limit irresponsibility basically scales everyone degenerate 
358506, saw arrogant ' explain wtf actually does leech 
358504,do think 200000 eth collateral used yo u described  ?  sounds irresponsible haha 
358501,aave should airdrop nft achievement when get liquidated 8 9 figs 
358500,that address has nouns nfts go drop stinkbids save poor soul longlingeth 
358495, systems haywire ppl could nt even move cent 
358492, would ve nt stop engine never forget 
358490,thanks prompt answer really appreciatednnso amount have give back protocol does move when market goes assume  
338115,that how works basically plebs have either many tokens use vote interesting antiwhale mechanics voting system whole kinda broken right revamped 
338113,ah yeah guess theory plebs would split plebs lots tokens plebs 1 tokens 
338111,how much released internally  ?  mean start 100m right away released 2m circulation per week how fast  ?  
338110,it tricameral theory plebs council technical committee practice reallynthere proof personhood despite us knowing people council tech committee actual unique people does really help regards technical decentralization decision making 
338109, really nt democratizing governance definition oligarchizing time s likely best do 100 believe need move forward 
338108, s personhood voting dot right  ?  s token voting board directors what understand  ?  teh technical board actually replaced token vote  ?  
338107, clear system would rely sort unique personhood thing which does nt yet exist 
338106, agree lot different ways improve voting system chosing way traditional llc works board directors etc exotic methods though moment m interested question does problem mentioned really exists  ?  yes looks strange re trying decentralize democratize almost everything talking fear governments amazon etc time whole system affected one person cz 
338102,that kind how polkadot works right ways got ta say loving 
338101,obviously would make decision making even way slower already see board directors elected way maybe even liquid voting where users delegate tokens directors 
338099,"we ' always ready paranoidal low level decentralisation cryptoweb3defi stablecoins which affected usa ' decisions usdc data storage which rely centralized products node networks ' dependence centralized infrastructure etcnnat time almost definative products rely decentralised governance which means token holders "" power "" largest token holders biggest defiprotocols how much power do have  ?  brief analysis ethplorer snapshot shows picture example uni aave dydx 175m8m holdings one biggest token holderaverage number votes last proposals uni 15m250k aave 25m25m dydx guess "" one biggest token holder ""  ?  binance least wallets tagged ethplorer binance ' nnas understand binance token holder participate governance though usually cex ' ' do binance would want become "" malicious actor "" does have power propose first suspend withdrawals stake govtokens needed vote "" malicious proposal "" hurt defiecosystem  ?  yes ' look binance cex ' like potential single points failure defiworld  ?  hope mistake logic "
338095, oh interesting have nt really deep dived polkadot solutions mostly concentrating developing ecosystem around application specific rollup definitely intrigues 
338094,we have evm contracts testing rust pallets mvp state currently run colored coins mode aiming cover much ground possible happy show around plenty games already developing us one diablo like thing one thing similar single player experience course skybreach thing happy explore options collabing 
338093, btw want try do have playable demo http alphalohquestlohdemo s bit rough around edges have bugs s still fun prealpha dm email enable access 
338092,we actually going ahead erc1155 erc721 yet stage where make final decision wrong rmrk polkadot right  ?  
338091, seems like would really benefit rmrk nfts s going held back erc721 looks great ca nt wait try gaming resurgence making miss gaming 
338089, crypto man have token economies everywhere people group created way meaningless tokens nt judged token value should nt worry thats opinion 
338088, well do have token know many people do nt like idea taxed tokens soon have nft series where essentially have find coordinates monster solving ingame puzzles defeat procedurally generated monster whitelisted minting 
338086,we do have bosses 
338085, defo like idea would invest tbh 
338084,would cool something like soulslike invasion style may have bosses haha 
338083,first solo campaigns space needs continuos updates people think working hard enough yeah multiplayer ultimate goal have ingame mechanics called portal where essentially type coordinates go multiple worlds within game portals would used introduce multiplayer system game 
338079,hi when convex holders bribed fxs vote guage where yield  ?  lockcvx do still need vote daily delegate  ?  
338078, wwwtwitchtvvideos1444786088 s demo game want idea how looks like 
338077, project working developing play earn game primarily rewards nfts usable gameitems ingame instead token s what need eth 
338076,what hellsing inu 
338075,anyone knows where get hundred ropsten eth  ?  
338065,why  ?  
338054, deployed using remix remix saves data when deploy  ?  
338053, do nt need verify 
338046, have code 
338045, does nt have abi 
338044,how recovered  ?  
338043, well ca nt do does nt remember function names 
338042, does nt matter 
338036,you ' need verify contract have access functions abi enough call 
338035,how does verification make difference 
338030, do nt even have access functions nt verify contract 
338029, s token contract have function add liquidity 
338025, have 100 supply tokens 
338024,if recall withdraw function name params call function 
338022, does nt have self destruct rekt 
338021, have selfdestruct function within contract default d return funds caller unless have address assigned recipient 
338019,actually good contracts deployed contract thought should go better one send eth liquidity older contract 
338018, contract nt one deployed  ?  would say luck 
338016, deployed contract nt verify etherscan disappeared remix do nt have access deployer interface mistanely send 4 eth wrong contract does nt have function take stuck balance s big amount help appreciated 
338015,debank used do even labeled different contracts moved wallet extension called rabby 
338013,turned revote dot cash works eth do know tool revoke approve sidechainsl2  ?  
338012, reading joeys tweet legit idea what explaining yearn said replacement xsushi needs help w communications start

337991,hahah what sham 
337988,what crazy mint 
337986,fairs want go boat twittercomamsarfest seems have found big boat party ill shush 
337985,has anyone tried using local hardhat node forked mainnet does work erigon  ?  
337984,wanted do smth w klibansky tbh busy af ' wan na do smth halfassed context 
337983, make sure boat has roof weather has nt exactly amazing 
337981,during dev connect amsterdam does lobsterdao want do private boat party  ?  
337971,it ' super complex stuff requires constant maintaince hard monetize... basically worst thing do probably 
337970,what opinions creating community owned etherscan alternative  ?  
337967, yo peeps whats cost effective way get access eth node without running read data blockchain  ?  need able serve peaks traffic tens thousands users peak times  ?  m told using infura alchemy rack thousands fees what using rpcs  ?  essentially need provider when users dont have metamask havent connected yet 
337966,what scammy rug wow 
337961,protip gas high check ultrasoundmoney dont wan na say scammy stuff 
337955,past 5m has somehow burnt 16k eth thanks guess 
337951,why gas like 4k gwei 
337942,hey guys name jeremy bragin film producer currently working docuseries one russia ' largest vod platformsnni ' looking connect lobsterdao team nncan possibly get touch  ?  u0001f91d 
337941,now sounds like dumb question think various protocols offering smart contracts service scaas uniswap provides scaas form permissionless liquidity pools where anyone deploy combination 2 erc20 tokensnngnosis safe provides scaas proxy implementation where new proxy contracts deployed created point canonical gnosis safe interface contract contains logic needed transactions nnwhat would reasons why two different forms how people deploy smart contracts  ?  what would happen uniswap used proxy implementation liquidity pools instead  ?  
337939,here playbook get lent tokens mm which fine carry risk get spread also usually get given free option receive tokens say 6month price k 
337937,that have ask even decide tell first place ' opaque also depends work require notional capital thenother side book use like wintermute what time period profit split engagement what directionally think asset usually ' mm what invest ' semantics basically ' find what looking trying deduct behavior sheer involvement mms magic 
337936,okay do do one side  ?  like possible service provides liquidity sells letting buys volatile  ?  
337935,not top close maintain tight spread larger orders happen without moving market much also prevents massive abritrage oppose where one scamware cex depegs another actually has volume well reality arb yeah 
337934,what does mean when alameda research says provide market making services  ?  essentially buy good portion supply makes continuous buys sells essentially always top bid ask orderbook  ?  
337933,sounds good how much pay delegators  ?  
337928, do  ?  s nothing unique unprecedented people think app devs interested faffing around consensus like make app people selling socalled app chains 
337927,agreed also question how many differently optimized chains need build games certainly must level makes sense 
337925, dont know need time see 
337922, do nt punch made typos thread ahah frenchies ans english long story 
337921, made thread twittercomchadasscapitalstatus1511302972206198785nnit fits ct topos aka might have quite degens part core hopefully sums things well give good first glance what do leveraging crypto nfts design economy undermine funding issues tradart b question act collecting live art end thread s github docs links nni leave introduction d really happy collect feedbacks d willing share really like guys seem well aware need position where listen take feedbacks account genuinely wan na meet new minds new mindsets kinda cool 
337919,how security problem appchain  ?  validator 1 team 
337918,nah necessarily example dot have one parachain super low collator count effectively accomplishing without needing build bridges etc 
337915, somehow figure highly reliable highly secure highly fast easy use bridges d agree definitely do nt see happening though 
337914, yeah agreed do nt see how one chain per app scale vs common optimized chains example dfk do nt need chain need gaming optimized one low decentralizatin high transaction throughput 
337908, never understood why polkadot auctions slots allows parachains become pretty close app specific instead launch large amount interconnected common goods chains 
337905,when dapps become bigger think have chain sure 
337903,lmao could banned ivangbi flushing 
337899,we could call appchains 
337896,would consider parachains dotsama ecosystem appchain  ?  
337895,but could see how much paid eth 
337891,we could call dydx appchain 
337876, okay share project  ?  do nt wan na shill s p got grant european union s led researchers artists kinda defi moon nothing imo what do interesting d curious collect feedbacks

360315, true anecdotally think blockchain industry has concentrated pool rust devs industries using rust should nt hypothetically blocker team get point maybe statistics completely proves hypothesis hiring rust dev blockchains wrong

360302, read name sunny king started fanboying second lol 
360301, well purely outsider perspective upgradability substrate platform seems pretty sweet developing blockchain something specific dydx seems like upgradability prospect clear winner have nt really handson experience building chain either hence question 
360299,can elaborate why think substrate better  ?  
360294, nice anyone does nt want deal rebasing taxes tax jurisdiction makes rebasing painful report 
360293,if have assets blockfi suspect should moved elsewhere coinbase binanceus seem going anywhere ftx well

360199, do nt have funds future unlocks projects 3ac gon na drop much  
360198,tbh have always wondered why chains use tendermint instead developing substrate substrate seems like better platform want build chain especially dont care part internet blockchains narrative 
360196, bnb smart chain longer have 21 validators provide candidates choose new mechanism nnachievement unlocked decentralisation 
360192, what s channel  ?  
360188,they have 40 afaik 20 elected periodically actually propose blocks 
360187,yeah cronos proof authority seems full permissioned bnb have elected validator 
360185,cronos has 27 last check bnb chain has 21 
360179,issue lot cosmos dexes lp pairs ustluna also 14 day unbonding period lpers got rekt hardnnthe reason shut ibc terra printed insane amounts luna created cascade which affected dex liquidity lpers could inmediately unbond lp pair

360170,pretty sure has less validators bsc 
360169,what abt cronos 
360167,does centralization get better time cosmos chain  ?  
360164,compared current infrastructure where orderbook matching engine run single entity generating proof executing trades 
360161,the plan starknet decentralize time sure what timeline side though 
360160,maybe something dont know eth network fees zkrollup big centralized sequencer reason 
360156,well least muh innovation lets see how ux 
360154,"they claim alternatives inadequate run clob dex want end state different cosmosnn ethereum l1 likely decentralized cosmos least time even close performant enough power dydx ethereum based l2s have two issues close performant enough power dydx see "" offchain decentralized orderbook matching "" also currently operate central sequencers which have ability censor transactions nn solid plans many l2s decentralize sequencer network likely would decentralized point comparable what could achieved dydx chain ethereum l1 "
360150,that would validium right  ?  rollup stores proof computation make data computation available blockchain  ?  essentially similar current starkex architecture replaced dac cosmos blockchain 
360149,would imagine cosmos much cheaper starkware need cut right  ?

360089, said pow analysis superficial mentioned mining pools specifically replied think s pretty clear point re going circles want add explanation how stratum somehow giant security hole would allow someone take 3 hashpools lead 51 attack please do 
360087, re accusing moving goalposts surely should nt do 
360085,ok what 
360084,all say look mining pools use really bad p2p software coordinate mayb eit could usedc ddos 
360083, analysis hashratestakeflow superficial s basically analyzed nnedit nok incorrect s analyzed context 51 attacks which makes sense since s where would mostly apply takes granted analysis locus power 3 mining pools extrapolates without accounting how easily hashrate flow 
360074, far ve done move goal posts understand what actual implications socalled grave passage ve called 
360073,thanks sharing ' mind centralized servers used asset hosting experience nnan example better 1000 words used play dofus french mmorpg day still have rare cosmetic item got 10 years ago nni would love seeing nfts facilitate trade back when wanted sell item fiat sell kamas game currency find virtual currency << xa0brokerxa0 >> okgoods good back lol sell kamas receive money paypal 
360072,that think mining pool legal entity remotely relevant certainly adds color what conclusion means 
360069,you should read report job find things 
360068,maybe ddos pool ok what 
360067,what actually do taking stratum

360058, mining pools do nt need legal entities one 
360055, meaningless distinctions within context analysis whether control direct does nt change reality number entities need coerce undertake attack mention next page goes specifics how mining pools actually function 
360054,as remember drawn prices btt ignited fomo among many thereby pushing demand bnb which trading volume increased significantly 
360052,you would usually even know real given private deals price performance also ' say much given assets went 
360051, think centralized exchanges have main income cases trading commissions including trading token 
360049,dont think many places have gatehred data unfortunately especially centralized platforms profits probably shared 
360048,yes would like take look deeper analysis what median tokens given platforms projects what trading volumes potential commission received exchange etc 
360047,since launch have 3 decentralized ido platforms least 10 sales have averaged profit users 
360046,cryptorank has probably data ieo ido platform performances 
360042,what launchpad  ?  
360041,hi guys does anyone have consolidated launchpad report 2021 2022  ?  
360040, fight man when s 
360037,being comissioned us governmanet could have little do 
360034,yeah best approach sure example would argue right metrics eth2 would far decentralized solana avalanche 
360031,the nakamoto coefficient represents number validators nodes would have collude together successfully slow block respective blockchain functioning properly 
360028, yeah super impressed past upgrades m constantly getting messari updates cosmos chains s meant disrespectful when dive substrate built upgradeability s elegant 
360021,yeah dont think level nerd s weird kink lot different someone fantasising kids spark intellectual debate 
360020, why ca nt have nice things 
360015, mmmm d tend disagree message passing chains cosmos superior polkadot imo lack shared security model could nt considered superior cosmos ahead adoption sure would nt say something binary cosmos superior polkadot s nuanced also polkadot has data availability built whereas cosmos has independent chain could argued s pro con depending which side fence re sitting 
360013,what site helped add multiple network config metamask  ?  
360012, get tech correct imo cosmos hub superior implementation have differences course end result cosmos also first vision afaik way ahead polkadot implementation adoption 
360011, damn dystopia does nt even work do nt have metamask installed 
360010,hey guys remember websites could breakdown ethereum transactions cant find atm 
360006, have nt read yet seems relevant assetsglobalwebsitefilescom5fd11235b3950c2c1a3b6df462af6c641a672b3329b9a480unintendedcentralitiesindistributedledgerspdf

360001,do mind expanding centralization issue  ?  right forum  ?  
359997, troll swear m interested general perception do nt mind polkadot performed poorly d rather get tech correct 
359993, meant terms vision reputation alot original ethereum founders reputations have nt exactly fared well whereas noone seems speak ill gavin also still seems aspire original ethos 
359991,coinbase has futures derivatives trading desk etc 
359990, mean describes eli5 way even normans understand which like 
359989,ftx has made huge jump foray going global 3 years coinbase has working making us politicians happy lobbying efforts help sustained long term effort regulation 
359988,either ftx already capital thencoinbase ipo which point coinbase has captured market share since perception coinbase better coinbase actually last year coinbase us uk eu 
359987,general thoughts gavin  ?  always seemed like one space still have reputation intact 
359986,because economist would say qe zirp would bring non existent demand future economies would raise trade barriers without ability export like 2008 economist would say lockdowns would automatically destroy economy massive creation money supply would enable politicians accelerate timeline greatest depression demand environment ' increase productivity furthers moral hazard pandemic created moment fud ended two weeks lockdowns started knew banks federal government one choice since ' admit ' leveraged crypto ' know fed govt would increase money supply 30 weeks eth btc recovered 
359980, ' grinded near halt ' means gas fees went dramatically  ?  what do mean  ?  
359976, ffr near 0 when liquidity crisis happened march 2020 qe nowhere near crazy nntreasury markets deepest markets world usually unload hundreds billions bills without moving price--20 bps max march 2020 could offload 20 million 10 year treasury bills move price 100 bps depth gone liquidity disappearednnwhat happens crypto time like  ?  well makerdao entered shortfall ethereum grinded near halt does nt surprise people thought saved last 2 years qe zirp going away 
359975,so people afraid qe zirp stop due pandemic  ?  why think  ?  
359974,without excessive risk profiles venture capital retail flush cash crypto markets break solely way absorb appetite risk high demand tech speculation which would have disappeared without qe zirp usa 
359971,naive question why people think covid kills crypto back  ?  
359968,how coinbase poorly  ?  ipo ' peak raking ' offer high yields since fall have lots venture capital different projects ftx firing people american way downturn ' japanese ' saying ' buy waiting 2q report which say many exchanges without sec reporting 
359958,is standard abbreviation lending protocols like compound aave etc  ?  feels like roughly many different ones dexes good short name 
359943,"no ser why super subjective different everybody convos nftavenue literally dozen times "" fork okay do devs need vested 3 yrs does launch have fair "" etc ' really "
359941, m okay ending conversation think discussion what quality actually means nft seems like legitimate topic conversation 
359940,"no something nonfactual random convo tried intervene convo got smileys "" nfts pixels "" "" what quality "" "

359902,neither have ponzi like either nfts ponzis defi ponzis have value 
359901,talk cheap dont need waffling objectively identify which one likely ponzi 
359898, someone smarter work right assumption maths saw user bases do nt overlap deterimined users high enough value acquire maybe team acquired really valuable 
359897, still ca nt wrap head around how integrating aggregator makes sense uni labs maybe wanted team develop inhouse nft liquidity protocol something 
359894,the nft whales ones sold flipped which frowned upon nft collectors ironicnnsome nft investors dislike defi cuz missed salty also ironic 
359890,uni bought genie means mainchat gon na ducked definft would new term ' image someone bought ape leverage long uni lending...etc 
359888,tbh need liquidity whale nft whales need attract defi actual have liquidity 
359887,maybe build speculative value opensea worth what u0001f937u200d 
359885, dunno have nt done maths nft whales hear phrase thrown around lol

359873,bold statement people whose arch nemesis screenshot tool 
359871, has do users re airdropping usdc retain 
359870, got ta do user stickyness team imagine uniswap could have copied much less 
359868, do nt understand how aggregator valued much dealroom valued around 40m ve developing aggregator since 2012 
359866,or anyone could operate said marketplace nnthe orderbook persisted arweave indexer node open source effect get permissionless operation aggregator 
359864, regards nft aggregators suppose neutrality would nt also operate marketplace 
359857,do want give disclaimer shill portfolio companies  ?

342119,hey guys place where find educational content sorted categories when comes crypto  ?  aka trading blockchain history dapp politic etc exemple 
342116,so apparently us dod forbids sha256 ec different curve bitcoin top secret systems what does mean crypto  ?  
342114,essentially even current status tax crypto unless do profession exact rules when become trader it s strictly set x amount trades days it s decided casebycase it s clear what triggers investigation comes have prove trader best luck trying collect tx history nnnew bill would simplify lot lot lower tax 5 really cheap tbh 
342111,the thing do buy nft someone else special angle somehow inject middle buy claim forward person frontrunning 
342107,it done lending platforms exchanges maybe thinking along lines twittercom0xbeansstatus1507900768359124992n twittercom0xbeansstatus1506074195351916544  ?  nnthe precondition kind stuff basically return nft within transaction opensea does allow 
342106,but said would assume transaction original buyer would fail sure case 
342105, mean attacher would free ape could buy ape when knows someone else bradcasted transaction buy ape price beeing sold attacker buys x price claim apecoin sells interested buyer x price got free ape buyer end ape apecoin 
342104, probably dont understand scheme why would someone frontrun buy transaction  ?  how does buy transactions make difference case  ?  believe anybody buy apes still collect airdrop collect airdrop return back  ?  wrong  ?  
342102,not sure would work moment frontrunner buys ape transaction original buyer should fail 
342100,no what done slightly different 
342099,yeah first ones hidden tax thatbwas decided based various random reason which could lead 50 correct im wrong though 
342098,this already done nftx when apecoin launched 
342097,and how could buyer protect case  ?  
342096, thought another attack using mev would possible when someone broadcast transaction buy let s say mutant ape still has ability claim apecoins someone could frontrun transaction maybe even flashloaning eth buy ape claim apecoin sell ape interested buyer eventually sell repay flashloan

369484,usdc euroc why ethc 
369483, mean objective have custodian behind have custody eth full instead using usdc 
369482,you do a la wbtc 
369481, s why goal use circle conduit 
369480, probably bridge risk what pairing curve 
369478,but requires alrdy have assets avax understand correctly  ?  
369475,as issuer would still taking lending protocols risk sc liquidations solvency etc 
369474,you could also have pure creditbased approach little direct backing mint syneth directly lending protocols offer lower interest rate borrows have curve pool peg 
369472,you could have lending protocol where provide eth ethereum borrow whatever want remote chain 
369468,the straightforwardless risky approach would still something similar stablecoin protocol makerliquity issuing synthetic eth 
369467,unless have different model mind 
369464, solves price exposure part does nt solve fractured liquidity partnnif have eth eth wan na buy smth avax have funds avax avaxnative synth does nt help 
369463, julrach have sent long dm list things do right know hectic have time please go 
369462,could create curve pool spot vs perp maybe 
369457, sort what m thinking

369409,not via create2 simply need salt hash output address obviously still impossible keccak broken would also break nearly ecrecover operations rely hash input onedirectional 
369407,you would need private key address 0  ?  
369404,use exploit contracts do zero address validation functions like acceptownership etc 
369399, generate collisions hashing zero please tell which create2 hashes zero 
369398, yes proving message hash 0 would nt have done much think would impressive found something hashed zero 
369396, think see what re getting root leaf  ?

355451, think main issue thing justification status symbol wrap lambo stickers favourite jpeg still valuable lambo without sticker average car market does nt care status symbol jpeg 
355449,unfortunately math fewer 8b use phone even fewer smartphone even fewer might care feature would able afford device even fewer need exactly what zhongfu has explained 
355446, especially when consider s already possible people make crypto payments buy nfts etc phone still get fancy apple ecosystem stuff 
355445,999999  ?  ' saying nft crypto app payments has 8k growing user base dedicated pays exorbitant prices things uphold multi trillion crypto market  ?  8k sounds low guess optimism makes sense long term 
355443,nobody saying it s impossible sell crypto jpeger 10m phone have going has crypto payments it s dead definitively 
355440,must fail pretty sure ' how social networks google etc tech history unfolded failed none made forever founder energy 
355439, samsung phone cryptocurrency wallet preinstalled do nt think demand 
355437, heh do nt realize things least problems when trying sell new phone re quite surprise 
355428,then product alternative app store which ton 
355424,idk one many try many things eventually win right model etcnnanother problem solved web3 dapps clunky compared native appsnnthe phone comes nft worth roughly pay price ' paying 3300k nothing nnand expensive nfts ' make cefi nfts would cefi 
355423,what name indian company going release cellphonepoint sale system  ?  u0001f9d0 
355415,then what would lol 
355413,but ' have 
355408,yes how many do  ?  
355407, know do nt need download apps app store 
355406,can have various price points bored apes one extreme example 
355402,pretty sure metamask mobile ios still has built browser 
355399,if goes well could also sell laptops desktops 
355389, curious v3 il system isnt primarily supported trading fees receive  ?  low volume vs market turn like we ve seen year create issue  ?  seems like prolonged bear issue stated launch 2020 vast majority time season lps would have gotten ton il since january bank run today would enough money cover il  ?  
355388,do have project  ?  
355386,well ' basically what ' happening right real collabland right  ?  
355385,what fake collabland manually assign roles ppl like 
355384,maybe have bear market project  
355371,how do feel collabland alternatives community has seen 
355363, pretty sure still need do math s registrynn docschainlinkdocsfeedregistry 
355359,what do mean cl price feed aggregator  ?  
355357, ecdsa nonce reuse unlikely ll unaffected since wallets have sane impl 
355355, account wo nt necessarily drained anyway s limited what do one tx 
355354,as signing transaction masquerading message depends what transaction 
355353,interacting malicious contract typically have minimal impact unless something like rune 
355345, clear algo stablecoin backed bnt do nt have one version 21 protocol released november 2020 has proven multiple adverse market conditions 
355344, hardware wallet worth salt would nt support something like 
355343,tbf know signing could do 
355338,we have multiple levers help us manage il risk protocol level tokens listed bancor get different amounts trading liquidity based risk profiles easily grow shrink liquidity pools order control how much il exposing protocol tonnbecause protocol providing trading liquidity also earning fees portion stake tokens bancor paired bnt which means half fees earned go towards bnt side pool protocol earns trading fee revenue bnt which uses cover il suffered lps withdrawal note pools experience il fact many pools profitable use cover il experience poolsnnseparately take 15 swap fee revenue vortex burner which burns vbnt vbnt represents locked bnt protocol supports trading liquidity applies deflationary measures bnt token consider insurance premium il protection providingnnin version 3 protocol have 25 security fee withdrawal which use replenish pools deficit tokens essentially use open arbitrage opportunity outsider supply us tokens deficit therefore guarantee higher probability receive tokens plus fees withdrawal token deposited 
355337, m sure do nt think s particularly clear since balances part state 
355335, how many gb space does storing ethereum active addresses balance take node let s say eoas 5gb 10gb 25gb 100gb why  ?  
355329,ok usd dollar fall should stockpile wheat  
355325, talking death spiral question insinuating scenario where likely 
355322,the vast majority bnt locked amm north 80 actually owned bancor protocol bnt used support trading liquidity token side deposits protocol never actively sells bnt means little bnt compared what protocol owns outside markets used drop price bnt token 
355318,you could do big issue aave interest fixed variable stream speed would constantly change which would require txs 
355309, imo furo does nt compare favorably others sushi paints built ape sdk llamapay big oofs noticed different units depositwithdraw which abstracted sdkfrontend anyway feature deposit behalf payer 
355308, different tradeoffs furo s system makes easy add yield top since money stream fixed going single person defillama pooled nature funds makes much harder do nt have feature 
355304,from understanding way works create stream 2 months provide money needed 2 months when starts ending add tokens another 2 months thus extend requires periodic actions streamnnllamapay works directly pulling money pool shared streams need top when runs low 
355301, kyber has single sided liq nt know allowed concentrated liq thought added pool 
355300, yeah manually prolong think llama do nt need do anything except periodically topping pot streams 
355298, agree start date future good fixed duration also good also have infinite duration 
355297, does nt 3 contradict 4 furo  ?  
355296, what s great say s easy build things top like what mentioned 
355293,if anyone llamapay revest has fnftlinked smart wallets would allow yall pretty easily replicate streamtransferability functionality without requiring corecode changes work 
355287,is dex has liquidity range uni v3  ?  
355282, have token xyz paired bnt bnt drops relative xyz ll have il xyz dailydefiorgtoolsimpermanentlosscalculator check calculations drop price token b keeping token price 
355279, would nt manipulation going wrong direction  ?  drop price bnt should get less tokens paired bancor d need artifically inflate price bnt use bnt cheap swap tokens  ?  
355278, manipulate s price arb token has large pools across multiple dexes guess though would expect have sufficient protections 
355277, think author tweet meant protocol gets exploited which leads token price crashing malicious actor dumps massive amount bnt initiating death spiral nothing seems impossible crypto anymore lol 
355276, yes m aware s token m asking how go exploiting said token 
355275, bnt bancor s governance token which gets paired every asset listed bancornnso bnt declines assets s paired lps suffer il 
355274,what does bnt get exploited mean  ?

355075, someone usually has canary coal mine though next guy does nt make blunder 
355074,technically address has private key should able sign transactions contracts deployed address suppose private key ' valid brute forcing private key impossible though 
355073, maybe problems should ve never problem first place 
355062,what hacker ends selling 
355061,they ' leave bag money around open delivered wrong house saying guy receiving should keep also ' think should painted hackerman

361411,if proper audits have followed security advisers would have pressed act blatant amateur move 
361410,"the likeliest entity bail would binance cz said something recently "" encouraging bad behavior "" bailouts letting protocols fail sure larping though trying appear "" fair "" "
361407,neither does 5 7 signature required 100k value  
361406, s actually what need know  ?  
361404, think could end ghost chain unless somehow manage salvage 
361400, u guys ever think harmony recover  ?  whats worst case scenario  ?   ?  have decent usdc worthless rn 
361398, does anyone have feedback skale network  ?  seems like everyone s talking subnets supernets parachains cosmos chains noones talking skale yet seem like compelling ethereum based solution blockchain service tm pending 
361381, vaults perceived better secure wallets reason many defi protocols choose deposit funds vault nnread alchemy blog someone explain technical terms why  ?  
361376, has anyone found reliable rollover ira us least do btc  ?  maybe gbtc m desperate looks like fidelity adding option 401k s point found niche places sure d trust 
361369, do nt know m misremembering thought 0xb blue check mark remember big defi summer something going cel big supporter linkswap sold account  ?  something dunno got big apes iirc s know 
361368, should know andre s alt account  ?  
361367, according what ve heard woodcoin has something do ecology 
361358, people desperate hopium s like when someone reported binance bought 100k btc people deposited 100k btc binance 
361356, what celsius s current wbtc liq price  ?  
361355,well bailout goldman stuff people should read better 
361353,this weeks announcements should settle everything 
368377,pancake has like 200k lol 
368376,consider uni v2 deployment has thousands mostly dead pools 
368375,well must have list important pools somewhere calculate tvl 
368374,but dont see why should have list smart contracts guess focus specific ones eg factory pools 
368373, might idea ll have look defi lama docs 
368372,ah well idk someone kind make list make publicnnone alternative could think scanning defi llama source connectors pasting 
368368, would indexing use case 
368367,usually teams publish addresses deployed contracts somewhere could hit approve look address etherscan trace back factory read contract 
368366,does protocol list exist  ?  similar token list protocols eg uniswap token address factory router 
368361,you also check defiyield rekt database ' comprehensive has auditor filter n defiyieldapprektdatabase 
368358,hey guys trying collect data companies hacked audit anyone has kind data collected already could please share  ?  
368355, got ta help where needed... 
368349,hey do guys know telegram grps where find people different projects  ?  
368337, hey s nice see around wanted say ve enjoying reading discussions have learning lot 
368328,hmm interesting sure why alt l1s dont do default seems like pretty easy win get rid chainlink middleman 
368327,also paper also focuses uni v2 twaps which different animal forms including v3 
368325,before ocr save gas ' pretty sure cl aggregation onchainnnalso polkadot pretty much has use nodes retrieve data do stuff onchain 
368322,meh debatable d nnbut yeah tldr what coiner wrote  
368321,beyond ' do much 
368320,the oracle should give assurances fetched correct value 
368319,so aggregate pass value onchain  ?  nnwhy should trust tho  ?   
368311,you do like liquity build closed loop never changeable end using cl tellor fall back anything ever happens ' fuckednnyou have immutability oracle level which means need good ways ensure ability change oracles ' get abused still designed way act ashoc 
368310, do nt know s dilemma much problem implementation really need something like uniswap where everything automated human tweaking ux chainlink 
368308,welcome dilemmannchoose where want immutability  
368307, get immutable data feed where need able switch another one need make adjustments one source acting adding sources etc nndoesnt mean anything relying immutable  ?  
368304,think difference made people running nodes cl multisig rug everything nnof course network diverse has bigger names participating ' change fact cl multisig point price aggregator somewhere completely else without timelock whatsoever 
368300,what stuff ' necessarily trade onchain  ?  
368295,you could use chain oracles based amms nnthey get bad rep people ' bother implement flash loan guardrails b often have much less liquidity honeypotnnbut none like insurmountable issues 
368293,"this kinda either situation tho nneither dapps step actively put work oracles go easy way choose managed service nn sorry shill ' currently working making types available nnget immutable data feed where need able switch another one need make adjustments one source acting adding sources etc nnget managed service la chainlink read "" ethusd "" without caring what happens underneath nnni think people go immutable stuff care enough believe majority industry simply gravitate towards what ' easier use  "
368291,one could also try building defi primitives ' require oracles like good old uni 
368290,"one way would make contracts immutable which would require projects able switch another one need adjust feed addremove nodes etc nnit would require dapps think oracles andor implement ways actively manage nnthat would remove multisig thus potential killswitch ' smoothconvenient enough nobody bothers nnwhy simply read "" ethusd "" without caring what actually happens underneath  "
368289, assumes bulletproof reason would use rather bunch intangible stuffnnguess s hope pray happening happens soon enough get real competition  
368282,the prevailing narrative chainlink good enough means people arent really seeking alternatives better worse good enough alternatives do exist bad real clunky integrate expensive which factor ethereum 
368280,and even choice have seen reputation counts little have good enough story 
368278, does nt work force 
368277,nothing still fully trust based cl could pull plug moment trust em ' would economically reputation wise irrational 
368271,what stops chainlink force choice surreptitiously implementing blacklist neuter andor break certain apps reliant  ?  
368267,well said could say many stablecoin projs

368220,dai already fully fully dependent regulation ' new imho ' usdc cool devs governance slapped top least collateral could danger ways go around benefit dai usdc blacklist dai address basically collateral dai attackable dai holders add rwa becomes true reality even doomer speculation which what kinda ps still full admiration makerdao people genuinely 
368219,if usdc depegs have bigger issues holding dai  
368213,yes maker vaults arrakis resigned admin functions otherwise maker would have approved 
368209, asked client send usdc usdt smart contract... confused what coin initially 
368208,you end dai printing dai basically unwraps  ?   ?  feeling dumb today could wrong 
368202,but wondering do guys knowuse mediawiki personal suggestions  ?  
368199, guess ' gon na need do unpaid work u0001fae4 
368196,did client use ui  ?  eg mm always wondered what common issue 
368195,why circle  ?  thought said usdt  ?  
368193, sent circle support email dont expect anything happen though maybe years theyll change policy recover funds 
368189, m afraid reality wo nt refund ever need chalk loss when using new payment route particularly unknown counterparty unknown competence always sensible do small test tx first check everything works expected 
368187,although might get annoying unblacklist contract has way upgrade withdraw wish usdt recovery process usdt recovery method token  
368186,right doesnt help nbut could blacklist make certain funds cant removed sc make quicker refund 
368183, used dai first place would nt dumb 
368173, s usdc contract do nt think usdt contract has 
368160,oh crap should still have withdrawal function contract believe  ?  
368158,ya ni stopped using ens one owned years ago expired get why should def have one  
368157, oh damn usdt id have chancen tethertoentethertokenrecoveriesnnit s even worse asked usdc sent usdt smart contract f 
368151, lol sort stuff always makes wonder why wallets do nt give warning 
368150,how do do 
368149, guess could reissue original account tokens do  ?  
368135,sorry spam think might have resolved along adjustments showed 
368134,would perhaps enough change last line return randomids tokenid 1 tostring  ?

368124,does anyone have website where see overview blockchain explorers different chains  ?  
368121,guys dm ' tell ' good point would love get feedback how make users trust us react message ok contacting dm  
368120,liquidity moat has option borrow 
368119,hi trying understand things eth staking sources article understand why people thinking beyond lido eth staking  ?  what frictions service providers currently posing which makes lido market leader  ?  
368118,how would user know extensions safe use  ?  
368107,what major protocols using vyper  ?  
368106,what best tool locate private variable storage position within smart contract  ?  etherscan decompile unusable waiting time 1190 minutes 
368105,another point consider when compounding fees expose il 
368101,not sure how savax pool implements technically split stake have rolling unstake periods least redeemed time minimize risknmaybe think unstaking queue  ?  nno clue how price risk though 
368100, anyone know how amberdata compares cctx s data sources  ?  has better exchangevenue coverage what s frequency  ?  s entirely clear what exchange data supported cctx documentation nn wwwamberdataiodocsn githubcomccxtccxt 
368099,unstaking ' immediate though should affect pricing  ?  
368098,unlike gbtcsteth savax unstaked today thus redeemablengbtc has wait regulatorsnsteth has wait merge future unstaking upgrade 
368095,what do yall think savax valued amount avax backing  ?  
368093, ie 1k harmony d get paid 50k one course three years nnfor clarity proposal what do things certainly do nt bode well harmony 
368090,different risks tho sure which one ' prefer lol 
368088,auto compounding useful guess really minor have gelato 
368087,there seriously cool ways could improve basic uni v3 design think actual limit orders guess kyber gave something 
368085, reinvestment curve compoundable constant product curve supports price range 0 infinity reinvestment curve aggregated pool maintain common price behaving differently price ranges pool have different amounts liquidity which affected exchange activities meanwhile reinvestment curve s liquidity remains ticks increases based accumulating fee swap part pretty weird  ?  compounded fees go constant product curve  
368065,has anyone made siginficant innovation cream finance oracle proxy  ?  code obviously old gold wanted know anything has done years since 
368063,where see  ?   
368058,lora has basic free network layer commercial versions available which pretty good issue less technology market adoption overall public spaces iot has anywhere near predictions 
368052,as explained stephangoss well known lora technically works well iot use cases adoption rates have poor different reasons high device density low power usage long range low bandwidth has exploited smart cities 
368044,continuing ethnwe have general found interesting things todaynthere seem specific pattern emerging rather already emerged nncan see details n insightssantimentnetreadethinanticipationofbigevents7028 
368042,any idea what crazy active addresses spike around midnight today  ?  
368035, which evm chains nt implement eip1559  ?  s list  ?  
368022,dont think honest 
368016,dunno how true remember talks maerak group ibm failed psuh platform supply chain actors level playing field looks like guys made blockchain anyway sigh always marketing clout anyway though guess actual value transfer 
368009, usually take investment advice ivan do exactly opposite 
368002,regulated finance  ?  what 
367994,we do trade 
367983," "" love "" how knew crap bought anyway made decent money "

367965, tbh do understand tcpip stuff 
367959,where sourcing  ?  
367941,what like do could also put somewhere keep coordinates g drive etc encrypted format 
367938,does anyone have opinion storing seed phrase 1password  ?  nwhat encryption software  ?  eg password gated folder flash drive 
367935,what options storing seed phrase aside paper  ?  
367934,thanks what needed 
367932,idk anyone have answer preference would suggest looking top forked protocols compound vs aave find common variables 
367927, think best see list top recommended point sometimes preference also depends how secure really want adding separate layers like early mentioned using separate android w internet connection 
367926,what do call overcomplication  ?  mentioned pretty simple basic opsec nothing special 
367922, what s best authenticator among 
367920, do nt really use authy m much help others might know better generally sounds good 
367916,what install authy iphone android 
367913,the problem default authy allows mobile device access phone number associated authy account download access private keys account somebody uses social engineering access phone could problem dont change settings 
367912, dont think would matter default authy 2fa account tokens stored locally 
367911,but authy has good have hacks authy  ?  
367910, would suggest everything create visualization mindmap maybe write where stuff security ca nt really do 
367909,yep happened when overcomplicating security have find right balance good organization system 
367908,that ' how lost online accounts much complicated opsec 
367903,smart would always use separate android device password storage pen paper whats go  ?  
367902, hm ok nt experience freezing tbh many accounts try transfer data authy new device surprise doesnt allow retrieve original code aegis does example which convenient 
367900,if have 2fa codes phone lot apps wrong first place 
367899, use separate android device internet access aegis open sourced app has good functionality back without emails shit like 
367898,yeah ' improve have lot apps freezes every time open 
367895, have nfc yubikey get codes someone elses android ios phone 
367893,also already have yubikey supports totp auth top yubiotp u2f pgp blah blah 
367889, ' diched youbekey favor authy well due versatiliy simplicity fact how easy have several devices redundancy 
367883,it gets hard when deal values certain address like topics logs 
367880, ya guess what ll do have done till annoying 
367879,for rust projects usually have create intermediate type which which serves binding code db code stored dbs native type code translate 
367876, guess postgres trigger auto lowercase could work already lower case unique indexes 
367874,hey wondering projects store addresses db how mixed vs lowercasenndo either lowercase everything use case insensitive search time  ?  
367857,revertfinance has tool 
367845,this may worknnhaha sorry kidding name plugin tranquility 
347499, believe project using luna collateral should have proactive ' even take obvious decision like maybe ' get information chainlink paused oracle 
347489, think major ones have already delisted pairs 
347483,price jumping 3 4k empty orderbook would able ensure stablecoin actually stable  ?  
347480, s how fortunes made still gamble course 
347477,end supply 6t mcap 100m lfg have billion still luna holders likely get  
347475, yes slippage s like 100 people redeem time last 10 ca nt get coz slippage collateral stable when coupled derivatives wo nt have terra part ii also overcollateralize 
347474, starting small sure like hayes says small what ll remain unless has access cexs 
347466, well given huge demand stablecoins why would nt feasible decentralize short derivative contracts business supporting stablecoins  ?  does nt dydx offer  ?  nor start small grow 
347463,you go guys ask money back hopefully dont get nope nn wbtcnetwork 
347461,he suggested stablecoin should erc20 need use wrapped bitcoins  ?  like how do redeem bitcoins erc20 stablecoins  ?  
347459, must introduce centralisation which brings whole set issues design places where inverse contracts trade sufficient size accommodate bitcoinbacked stablecoin service current ecosystem occur centralised exchanges cexs 
347457,you have account slippage well 
347455,lol stablecoin tied volatile asset what go wrong 
347452, think covered how would sustainable how fees would collected 
347451,nevermind get what pay sure simple lol 
347448, omg have creating stablecoins going longshort 5050 asset arthur s idea similarnso instead backing stablecoin pure bitcoin volatile undercollateralization risk when price drops back stablecoin synthetic dollars created going longshort 5050 bitcoin stablecoin redeemed 1 bitcoin which stable btc paired equal value short derivative contracts go opposite direction pricewise n cryptohayesmediumcomlunabrothersinc712ec5abe199 
347444,that where using luna collat 
347438,the retail barely week ago would tell strongest convictions wrong said anything bad luna friends 
347433, s token does nt actually track anything trades sideways strange 
347410, one worst things happen business recorded history outside physical harm do nt think world has ever witnessed significant loss funds evaporating small time frame 
347402,when fees stop coming fees technically worthless  ?  
347396, really liked harry potter that s why 
347392, when does binance stop adding zero s  ?  
347387,nah see hundreds people twitter boasting how low price have bought lol 
347386,has bots buying point 
347378,should get day 
347377,what happens chainlink oracle price low has many decimals  ?  
347376,the thing do luna binance trade withdrawals deposits suspended

356002,only when get propose block guess lol

367224,several papers propose range payoff functions mathematically possible also allude end linked paper future work where complex financial products discovered arxivorgabs211113740nnseriously do favour read last 12 months ' papers guys wrote arxiv 
367223, actually guess 3rd innovationcomplexity first version which already implemented uniswap v3 allowing stakers choose price range which would like yieldsnnif think staking positions equivalent l2 data order books nnas why someone would rather stake take position market would stakers group have incentives discover prices efficient way left answerednnbut amms figure catch 2 birds price discovery easy liquidity d breakdown current paradigm easy liquidity vs price discovery 
367222,octolinker what need 
367221,does paper detail what complexities would  ?  see 2 possible ways amms could add complexities nn1 investors execution traders look pricing across venues amms order books otc desks batch auction exchanges etc would certainly impact how price discovery happens setting expectation where right current pricing amms have indirect way contributing price discoverynn2 amms used bootstrap liquidity when conducting large private transactions la like fashion sizable private investment fashion think already happening degree  ?  nnalso do have links paper  ?  
367220,yeah agree although depends way lps behave dex example have dex where lps always passive dex prices always long ' arbitrageur move back line 
367219, hmmm would nt worry even claim say cex dex s people have different views what pricing would reason s incentive trade across twonnor have case where s much execution risk dexs 
367218,yeah totally agree referring currently prevalent cfmms excluding univ3 which afaik bigger one moment requiring active lping require arbitrageurs eliminate price discrepancies yeah open amm term also include types amms also ' even discovered yet guess ' right 
367217,"after reading amm papers megabrain team chitraevansangeris last year ' come opposite conclusion amms simply "" passive "" amms hold latent potential space arbs part necessary ecosystem moreover symbiotic relationship two organisms has yet fully understood explored price discovery obvious first order effect relationship which hints something far complex coming future perhaps amms appear passive today ' awaiting innovation unlock "
367216,"my hypothesis would passive tvl have dex pool higher vol given asset pair trading volume one might expect see capital kind ,, energy "" needed flow update dex compared cex markets "
367215, going back dashboard shared nt noticeable bumps volume s attributed ammsnnthat d suggest amms still have nt found use cases would drive significantly larger volume exchangesnmost prevalent use cases ve seen dapps part amm ecosystem liquidity guys do nt need super high volume trades nn wwwtheblockcodatadecentralizedfinancedexnoncustodial 
367214,yeah what ' interesting also think how staleness large tvl pools could potentially find interpreted market signal e lps remain passive accident laziness choice staleness pool gets whole different meaning one might consider deviation compared cex wrong sense cex dex 
367213,ahaha see point nownnassuming amms adjust price market arbitrage conclusions thenn1 amm volume course driven volume order booksn2 ratio amm volume dex would increase higher volume environment since right much less volume amms approx equal increase absolute volume much higher percentage increase total trading volume amms 
367212, think amms ' really contribute price discovery ' little bit point trying make earlier amm passive lps waiting arbitrageurs come adapt amm ' really taking active role price discovery arbitrageur ' pushing amm line thereby establish price discovery relates back question what might reason increasing trading volume dexs compared cexs where think one reason dex amms passive need arbitrageurs adjust new prices which entails trading volume order kind update dex ' amm state where amount trading volume needed do higher passive lp tvl have 
367211, adding slowness large tvl amms what game theory conclusions  ?  nnfor example pretend have 1 order book exchange where price discovery happens 2 amms 1 significantly larger tvl othernnwould market overall have incentives allow arbitrage happen low tvl amms therefore pricing larger arbitrage opourtunities larger tvl amm  ?  nnperhaps s easy comparing multiple frequency which arbitrage opputunities happen potential profit per arbitrage 
367210, hmmmmm mean token traded amms yes s really equivalent l2 data amm world yeah d have incorporate data streams god knows what sources how long takes maybe already exists speed price discovery would time incorporate l2 like data amms time orders executennif token also traded order book exchanges consensus order book where price discovery happens amms exist quick liquidity speed price discovery rate which happens order booksnnyou could argue amms aid price discovery would love see reseaech conduct one nt literature yet even d guess speed price discovery speed fastest amm trade bit slower order books moment though 
367208,"yeah maybe word ,, slower "" ' ideal what meant tend need trading volume dex incorporate new market info compared cex where have regularly updating orderbook also without trades happening "
367206, see what mean price discovery slower why would market wait trade large tvl amm finishes executing  ?  seems like market would want price discovery happen speed fastest element 
367201,if have issues manifold sambacha might able help 
367200, tried existing rpc solutions claims provide flashbot protections reality none actually work basic eth rpc much faster txns never get stuck anything do  ?  tried flashbot eden manifold securerpc txns never go fails 
367197,"yes exactly higher vol causes arb opportunities dexs also cexs given prevalent passive lping many dexs which leads trading volume one would expect effect become pronounced tvl ' passive lp dexs arb opportunities get bigger arbitrageurs trade bigger sizes agains pools ' back line paradoxically one could argue higher tvl passive lp dexs actually makes price discovery somewhat ,, slower "" less efficient need move capital get new pricing info reflected pool balances implied spot prices guess ' somewhere sweet spot though where do want have meaningful tvl passive lp dexs able absorb ,, normal "" trade sizes ,, much "" tvl could actually become detrimental efficient price discovery need lot trading volume keep markets line "
367196,  ?  idk why feels passive aggressive nnthere ton data sources dex cex trades do correlationcausality studies do nt know why re bringing trading bots sandwich attacks 
367195,yeah makes sense ie volatility typically causes volume that d relegated dexs since frequent price differences would mean arbitrage oppurtunities  ?  nnbut i m curious why would ratio volume btw cex amd dex ever change significantly  ?  
367190,what best current blockchain node provider deploy tokencontract  ?  
367189,and have shit tons bots running sandwich trades stuff well right  ?  
367184,from what  ?  
367183,my memory hazy using catnip iirc lps could mint yesno shares 
367182,does augur issue fixed number betshares per bettopic  ?  
367175, think another reason could except univ3 dexs based passive lping whereas cexs generally require active market making result cexs tend regularly adapt incorporate new pricing information virtue frequently updating orderbook even when ' trades happening whereas prices produced passive lp dexs less often updated lps passive except univ3 sense waiting arbitrageurs come push prices back line trading agains pool naturally prices tend lag behind when proactive lps actively market make passive lp dexs liquidity lower slippage result trading volume one would expect see larger trades needed update prices accordingly incorporate new pricing information illustrate consider extreme case where ' one cex active mms one passive lp dex infinite liquidity ' new pricing information clearly rather easy mms update prices have somewhat quickly reflected new orderbook state cex however prices dex require infinite trades update pool balances reflect new price attracting infinite trading volume 
367171,clearpool has kind otc pools permissioned pools ex jane street blocktower have one

366901, would cool easy way avoid attack vectors tbf ideally d want remove gating much possible 
366899,yes when talked michael curve point why addreward needs permission reduce attack vector nyeah lbps totally different curve pools reviewed managed pool documentation originally misunderstood boosted pools what wanted differentnnbalancer great regularly recommend people keep watch managed pools later year consider future projects 
366898, what re describing possible managed pool which available later year lbp designed have incentives exist perpetuity nnnoting lbp discussion separate curve do lbpsnnprobably fair point may mention 3rd party reward tokens docs ll look ldo thing balancer s wsteth pool though possible like curve have ask us add reward token anyone could add reward token gauge would open attack vectors 
366897, speaking frankly documentation lbps interesting unclear permissionlessness rewarding xeth pools 3rd token really liked idea changing weighting pools time goal nt distribute pile tokens buyers directly price discovery create incentive create x token which must minted protocol nnif looking reward xeth pools x token w price discovery mechanism x raise eth daotreasury think balancer lbps would have primary contender honestly opposed yeth lbp w rewards via lbp future nnbut curve clearly visible do xeth rewards examples like stetheth rewarded ldo made easier coordinate what wanted wo trying ask something newunheard ofnni nt see examples bal documentation outside lbps fair launch pricing

350839,new shit has come light hope evidence coming 
350837, tee hacked would data breach isolated cpu  ?  would seem like arweave way dangerous since encryption algo universal data stored algorithm figured data exposed nnif s case what s reasoning choosing tee vs arweave  ?  
350835, intel s trusted execution environment tee secure area cpu people prefer trust remote computation encrypted data tee has hacked times exposing sensitive user datannarweave storage arguably permanent encryption algorithm used store private data ever hacked private data could become accessible othersnnipfs has native incentivisation layer people could stop storing document need pay trusted companies pin document

352714,for v3 yield essentially depends ability use right ranges liquidity average liquidity providers have neutral negative payoff ' mean ' profit congrats do  
352713,it ' impermanent loss calculate since depends following variables none which related pool n prices weth wbtc beginning periodn prices weth wbtc end period 
352711, where calculating wethbtc pair years uniswap existed  ?  also use uni v3 have nt used v2 much since v3 came 17 today uni v3 pair though s using defi llama dashboard would bet s higher reality would have check fees vs liquidity past 24hrs sure 
352710,pls ser how use  ?  
352705, s quite interesting how cheap lps willing sell vol think big part lps see way take profits dca assets similar why lot people use ribbon vaults maybe alternative ways sell vol like primitive finance makes market efficient unsure though 
352704, squeeth yeah squared eth option which has price designed follow eth squared which theoretically good hedge constantproduct invariants nt expensive though 
352700,that said ethusd pool curve eg without btc hedging would probably easy uni2 sushi 
352699, beleive could use squeeth theory also heard appears expensive practically useful 
352698,would elaborate how  ?  
352697, speaking univ2 curve example right  ?  nbut provide liquidity univ2 incentivzed ethusdc pool instance what s way calcultae right options straddle position proxy hedge il moreover do have perpetual option market maybe ftx  ?  idea 
352696,could suggest where find abi unverified contract  ?  
352690,only liquidate though going give x supply away really ' matter what price 
352688,isnt backwards  ?  dont haveare getting money token matters theoretically quite bit 
352685,depends goals project look pump price well that s why pospone launch idealbetter market conditions 
352681,true have never done liquidity funds usually price amm positions like options nnthen essentially hedge buying another option see crab strategy opyn instance usually payoff negative when cumulate positive times especially when pool incentivized what mean long run farming opportunities should disappear tokens should accrue much value market starting realize 
352678, serious question anyone know why optimism decided airdrop launch rather bad market  ?  does nt seem like huge urgency why wait  ?  
352677,that ' true although compute il even when liquidity pools exist v2 like amms using tool dailydefiorgtoolsimpermanentlosscalculator nnfor instance weth wbtc pair impermanent loss reached 479 010116 010522 which means need 1055 apy break even today apy uni v2 26 
352675,providing liquidity volatile pool share fees farming rewards heavily inflated token defi 20 doubled stack eth past 8 months risk il diminishing returns growing pool chasing yield always have direct claim eth contract level without depending dao vote multisig release funds sure eth price might tank always have access underlying eth eth stack grows fees like irl reward token created expressly farming which may may have lasting value future depending governance revenue intent ability founders community strength million factors 
352674,which why want avoid using things like give individual users api key 
352671, s actually bit risky part how agencies like fbi investigate crypto scam chase rpc callers get data centralised node providers like alchemy told founder top100 coin which has something do privacy

349389, one main challenges interoperability indeed security said what good assets transferred across chains have inherently centralized validator base went typical 5 presale vc rounds launch  ?  nni d argue biggest hurdle interoperability necessarily make technically possible actually find two chains sufficiently decentralized security maintained

346039,dont forget 3pool 1bsp going live like 2 days ' going help arbitrageurs 
346037, pool imbalance likely short term fluctuation larger orders filled equally reported prices probably using third party apis which smoothing underlying assets prices calculations 
346036, do nt maintain 3pool 
346034,that does explains constant 3pool imbalance 
346032,tether still has orderbook given market likely large market order 
346025,that weird feeling when u feel horrible bad still got ta laugh memes lol 
345986, have feeling have seen creative solutions deployed yet 
345979,but always clear luna would potentially go 0 peg does restore quickly enough 
345976,logically definition works includes price luna going ust demand increases opposite should also hold 
345975,ah get what saying yeah luna rekt ust wont go back peg either think 
345974,depends what prioritize peg luna  ?  lol 
345969, yeah s what thinking mechaism worked peg should have restored when luna fell 90 
345968,most likely ust still massively peg luna approaching 0 way remaining liquidity luna enough fix also incentive people buy luna would like donation ust holders 
345965, sure problem nt bsc rpc s  ?   least hosted servicennstreamingfast has grant graph develop solution called firehose parallelises data input ll roll production network later year  overview solana breakpoint conference 
345960,what happens luna goes ust price  ?  death spiral dynamics pretty much remains right incentive burn luna ust  ?

345956,who owns liquidity though  ?  does have hundreds millions liquidity basically renting hoping stays around  ?  
345953,yeah have specific insights beyond rumors ' get wrong point purely gov starts investigating finds good does something pretty deep trouble understanding ' really transparency how much what kind assets currently held ust nuking seems like big black swan 
345951,which when ' 200 transactions multiple chain operations required unpack tx explains 12 block delay 
345950,to process entity block which hundreds thousands sometimes 
345948, sure what mean full thorough disclosure assets investigation looked books revealed time tether backed around 70cents plus debt sure ve gotten worse closed gap rumors tether insolvent d think would have found something damaging 
345947, s still observable 12 block latency realtime which told time entity operations sequential take around 30ms point still stands indexer fit purpose need realtime data s fine casual queries do use graph data trigger strategies onchain example where timely information needed 
345940,furthest thing net positive considering every algo stablecoin damaged mention like literal scams it s money could ve gone legitimate projects oftrepeated dont invest dont like pretty naivenncalling good have ever tried calling something when numba going  ?  walls make better conversation 
345937,what ' reserve set frax days  ?  
345934,let ' pray does 
345931, think has ok collateral though

345918, do nt think net positive like byproduct defi freedom net positive 
345917,from two wys n1 ban luna way anothern2 let people stablecoin builders learn trial error nni would choose second 
345915,that response idea saving ust increasing apy ignoring fact would even work

345908, nt problem logic markert watches sees front runs shorts luna  ?  time have voted luna already 0 
345907,so opinion whole lunaust thing net positive space should done like time  ?  nni asking regulation simply bad ideas get called especially becomes undeniably evident bad ideas 
345901,guys anyone redeemed ust luna  ?  manual how do  ?  
345900,there though let everyone wants leave ust leave luna close 0 ensures project survives reduce retarded apy anchor put cap which gradually increased ust supply 
345899, stop putting resources failed let die dont start bailing stuff does deserve nt what people always criticize existing system  ?  
345898,there magic way make less ponzi project obviously prone do downward death spiral first days 
345893,yes sure do have dump addresses  ?  
345891,you compare usdt depegged due liquidity issues among uncertainty principle fully collateralized do reply muh usdt conspiracies thx 
345890, sounds like re dragging pretty historic experience  give examples services issues verify problem still exists  ?  hunch does 
345889, yes where s address tho  ?  want see new mints 
345888, hard say usdt hit 50cents point s largest stable coin agree does nt look good impossible get point where crypto people forget honestly people s attention spans could next year

345855,whilst branding has anyone extended logo check beyone cryptologoscc  ?  
345851,they try sqeeze little bit liquidity die hard followers big players exit fundamentally game ust reputation burned thats what stablecoins feed even still personally believe thing regulatory risk high sane person use gg 
345848, believe what want do nt believe spent treasury yet basically saying let s have flash crash maybe buy bottom 
345847,if worked luna would have dropped ust would have kept peg better ust dropping low sub 25cents death spiral has started 
345845,really nothing ' late ' magically create demand ust make system better dumb please correct does 
345844, yeah basically s saying people want sell ust problem arbitrage mechanism slow making people want sell even increase speed mechanism reducing fear caused depeg basically people want sell luna holders have take pain 
345840,what does faster mechanism do apart crashing 0 one day 
345831, would love hear deciding whether exit big loss hodl

345789,self regulation looks like certification tags boxes products buy self regulation would look like best legit stablecoin players making review board assigning certifified non risky stably coin legit players consumers know what holding problem would usdc right have bet goodwill current best players let new players 
345788,or recent iterationnn dont talk good vs bad projects that s dangerous 
345787, do want right make money  ?  
345784,if does lot trust lost ofc

343235,macro what lmao bitcoin 10 near 19 10 
343234,what kinda bothers contract functions dutch auction price computation complex contract afaik ' auction ' understand why another method distributing sale would also cause lower fees would actually let yuga keep majority fees burnedpayed miners 
343231, one thing even gas optimization would prices have low  ?  s first time simple nft contract used cost essentially what people ready pay mint even contract efficient people would have bid end around price maybe network congestion would have lasted shorter amount time think would have seen prices even optimised contract say minting could have better handled sure could have 
343227, think market expected yield war ust vs usn honestly probably overreacted said looking how ecosystem evolve time still do nt anything related near 
343226, do nt outplay luna ust yield why even care  ?  
343223,oh ok think aurora whole near ecosystem making lot steps considering amount money backing near ecosystem do see lot progress made glad attack resulted attempt another exploit 
343222,just speculation since address has funded tornado 
343221,can explain how think attempt  ?  
343214, do nt want think exploits defi drama ve encountering past days has also spilled luna ust ponzi scheme 
343213,very broad maybe vague has macro datasets metaverse gaming nft messaging clear though typical consultantsnn wwweycomenustmtwhatspossibleforthegamingindustryinthenextdimensionnnliked line regarding mass adoption though n half surveyed executives say lack standardization accepted currencies across platforms impacts viability nof digital assets within gaming industry 47 cite high transaction fees many industry insiders believe mass adoption come when users buy sell nfts ease purchasing item online single click 
343209,what happens when ust mc greater luna mc  ?  
343201,is technically impossible do understand something  ?  
343194,basically spent average 1 eth per mint 55k mints possible burnt 55k eth nnthe nice thing beneficiaries unless trying transact auctionnnif would have raised mint price 1 eth per mint theoretically could have captured value instead going burn 
343188,or do like pixelvault take care fans avoid gas wars 
343185,less gas usage mint txs block madness ending much fastern even though amount eth paid minters would change much 
343184,but seriously though amount gas fees paid case lands does depend gas optimization everyone competing get land others causing priority fees higher highernnoptimizing contracts case would lessen gas paid overall would change split base feepriority fee gas optimal contract would benefit miners benefit priority fee 
343182,erc721a nature beneficial multi mint eg when one mints 10 nfts one batch lands minters restricted have 2 per wallet erc 721a would beneficial mint causing higher gas consumptions trading 
343180,yes hand have erc721a nnand ' curious why use analogues 
343177," do unoptimized erc721 sc understanding mint process hugen gas wars beginn "" need chain "" nn "

343174," would consider eth holding "" dirty "" point lp ' aware shouldnt liable "
343172,if factor yuga would polygon 
343171,smart contract optimization would make gas fees less case centralization would though guess ' where yuga heading 
343170,the one backer internet us dod what  ?  
343168,because quite simply decentralization reason crypto start normalizing centralization ' different fiat--except ' putting trust tech startups vs centuryold establishments argument crypto would lost decentralized tech kinda sucks get better time 
343167,how cryptokitties chain flow  ?  much hype since nba top shot success 
343165,yeah what what people actually need want  ?  what nobody retail actually cares block shit muh decentralization ugly ux ui  ?  m3an still using metamask hello 
343164, d bet rollback chain when scams occur lol 
343163, wait apecoin chain  ?  where ve landed  ?  
343159, love how position decision consequence what happened today completely doing--did nt gas optimize contract beyond important things could have done meanwhile already made decision when apecoin released ape token ape coin 
343157,why optimise contract move new chain 
343149,how erc721a could have saved  ?  
343147,otherside devs could have spent 10 min gas optimisations saved community millions 
343142,would anyone lobster interested dual twitter space otoco io talk legaltax side things employeesemployers defi space  ?  could cover liability things like getting mortgage credit card 
343139, gas wars way beyond what s shown txstreetcom 
343137,what fucking wild weekend 
343124,why tho  ?  
343121,what shit show 
343115,nft trash should live rollup where piss cheerios 
343111,why ' block nfts network  ?  works bitcoin 
343110,no maybe maybe could reopen topic gas limit  ?  
343103, what s going 
343096, eth  ?  guess s why etherscan gone 
343094,not quite delay crocswap has speed bump feature 
343087,from what understand agreed restart chain certain block 
343086,binance also has cheap txs though 
343083, think lt yuga okay bears wanted take position bears binance rejected withdrawal when l transferred usdt ftx floor 3x original time interest 
343082,speculation does take fact coordinating what need order restart probably yuge task last time think 19 hours got back  ?  
343081, cheap txs mainstream love security sustainability does nt matter 
343079, least s took something around time last times when solana went rather true 
343078,lanched separate account what have solana use solana what have bnb could use bnbnalso functionality works thing isnt work depositwithdraw 
343077, might have player activation code system ' annoying  
343076,it has stuff sol bnb chain 
343075,stepn launch bnb yet right game also should  ?  player verify  ?  
343061,lt has hour tryingto avoid shorting sol 
343058,hi follow question does anyone know delayed dex execution focused projects  ?  like averaging beyond say what want tie swap execution arbitrary pricevolumegas related rules  ?  
343057,sometimes issues arise when have protocols interacting eg recent synthetixsushiswap issue synthetix uses unique proxy implementation 
343053,cosmosdb has tla spec github even 
343052,all offerings have formally verified consensus mechanisms enforcing operations 
343050,you mean sam office why would stop building solana  
343047, what s interesting solana downtime nt really affecting people willing use solana build top solana 
343024, have 
343020,anyone has around 3 goerli eth  ?  
343016, damn do nt remember one sushi xsushi one  ?  listing claimable assets value per share instant manipulable  ?  
343015,aave critical vulnerability went unnoticed year missed multiple audits luckily security researcher reported responsibility collected bounty could have let complete protocol drain audits often bullshit 
343014,clearly still lot rinse repeat ecosystem need do 
343013,yeap seems pretty fcked situation theory market should balance new auditor firms should come lot prices times could taken dev eng could get 10x making token whatevs whats incentive midtier auditing firm 
343012,there ux benefits token transfer triggering contract pattern has never really caught defi devs especially newer ones often ' recognize reentrancy risks 
343010,the great auditors ignore cloutless booked 500 years projects clout course do it s said great business -- projects look great portfolio also pay nice fees should come surprise cheap auditors chosen 
343009, agreed complicated aspect could apply service needs carry insurance liability reasons medicine least us decent perfect analogy physicians carry malpractice insurance do nt think means re practicing medicine though 
343007,well yeah kind have limited resources get two audit requests anon team another aave know which one better business well which one least likely get hacked 
343002, want audit projects think have reasonable chance getting hacked nnwhat does even mean  ?  
342999,yeap reason why auditor market broken basically demands incentives completely align least yet c4 strives good middle ground imho 
342997,getting real audit increasingly difficult scrutiny good firms dont want deal anons want audit projects think have reasonable chance getting hacked top long wait times insane rates mean protocols go real auditnnso yeah get what pay people should realize audits worth 
342996, toughest part retail users want audits do nt have big budget rubber stamp idk maybe better try inform community side 
342995,yeap do knowing rubber stamp question misleading inform have audits  ?  
342992,ah able execute contest yet does seem pretty timeconsuming generate report right  ?  
342990, know audit find everything s impossible why bug bounties exist 
342987,that ' smth bad audits one has found smth audit covers everything unless mistakes mistakes trivial ye ' sign 
342982,step copy stepn  ?  would have thought nanyone thinking ' actually trying serious stealing money gon na wonder one point why ever believed lol 
342981, know included re satisfied what came 
342973, jewel first intro yield farming uniswap fork w gamification pretty cool features behind farmed got 95 lock 5 unlock exploit found allowed people unlock remaining 95 dump market mods knew months nt do anything 
342968,is what kids got rugged latest  ?  people behind  ?  
342964,fair suppose methinks something tad weird end result buying maybe probably wont lose money using do regardless when happens promise hold us part whole liable statement statements would claim much 
342962, yeah 10x would nt feasible top tier audit firms one 
342955, wonder what insurance costs similarly risky things mature insurance market does anyone know  ?  
342953,sounds like something would need change insurance end things hard see how happens 
342950, whether adding liability would cause 10x s debatable ca nt charge what nobody willing pay s why wo nt happen -- s enough demand willing pay current rates s incentive anything change 
342940,did peckshield provide inputhelp finding issue back when guys hacked getting audited  ?  
342937, ca nt believe peckshield still does song dance every hack 
342935,where reentrancy  ?  
342925,nobody would ever work w premise sorry makes 0 sense 
342922,what feel hired bunch people ogs took mgmt position 
342920,"it ' wrong discuss things ' 100th time "" genius "" ideas thrown around ' what ' annoying haha 3 much love "
342918, bit aggressive sir do nt think concept holding people whose negligencepoor work accountable outlandish concept s certainly outside crypto plenty damages have irl negligence inspectors like answer might seem obvious re looking inside protocol building getting audits s obvious would nt work end 
342915, want cynical value audit stamp produces revenue without security secondary since exploit 612 months road does nt matter ve already cashed chunk profits 
342914, yeah think correct market does nt seem learning lesson firms like peckshield 
342909, protocols should nt buy insurance issue users concerned should ones buying insurance 
342907,yh thats what sherlock does 
342906, fair point costtime increases think realistically auditing firms would have purchase insurance do nt know what market like assume bad expensive 
342905, think adequate approach could include insurance pool audit process 
342900,would seed stage protocol pay 500k 1m audit  ?  when raised 15m 
342899, does nt solve anything rather makes extra difficult thing execute have downside issue arises time future 
342898,but think service still desirable maybe every auditor should do think would good 
342896,making auditors liable would put 10x premium audit prices would 10x slower 
342895, particular reason think projects should nt negotiate sort arrangement  ?  seems like helps align incentives properly 
342894, nah auditors should nt liable people should specifically know which auditing firms do nt give fuck reputation avoid even represents product launching 6 months due queues firms 
342891,the guys sherlockxyz testing theory love team should check 
342890, seems auditors should liable extent part audit agreement s something protocols negotiate part contract opposed general liability sort thing 
342887, tetranode what s going  ?  
342886,people talking auditing firms instead pointing correctly ones do shit feeding beast audits dont work auditors should liable point shit factorylike auditing firms peckshield pessimistic etc 
342885, ca nt detect simple math vulnerability code reviews still have face post kind stuff 
342881, pretty much have eyes boomers btc except 2022 currently still long way go outperform traditional assets always everytime stuff like happen s feast 
342880,so how possible get hacked  ?  
342876, generally speaking getting constantly audited which protocol does nt matter 
342870, also s kinda useless get audited launching stop thereni think protocol huge tvl should undergo periodic security auditing otherwise shit like keep happening main problem everyone trust protocol others already 
342866, many hacks happening lately true gathering attention big playersnit s also true have 1 protocol exploit week growing gon na kinda hard

366712, s time place everything decentralization sake decentralization nt always best idea said sometimes does take solid team drive project especially when financial related matters involved get go sometimes s okay hand certain day day responsibilities community 
366710,kinda become dictatorship maxi recentlynnu name differently disruptive things made strong leadership vision goals processes 
366708,after reading have one question how get code fot party  ?  
366704, do nt think got point tbh nfts staked well want do million things staking erc20 erc20 vs erc721 whatever incentive mechanism dynamics design what matters anyhow said somehow agree protocol value transfer should place incentivize healthy development community  
366702,the big difference part inflation usually tokens staked where get apy annual inflation witch without new users creates sell wall nfts inflated new buyers 
366699,somehow agree economics part erc20erc721 technical specifications standards may have end result have erc20 max supply 10k make non transferable play have erc721 minted millions have real difference practical terms erc20 what meant relevant part economic dynamics how do plan healthy incentive mechanism incentivize coordination multiple parties different interests one single goal dump neighbour techs mere tools what matters essence game dynamic 
366696,nft personalized know belong what do want 
366694,and when always problem dao ecosystems conflicts interests high user turnover 
366693,yes token completely different economics nfts rather made tokensnwith nft like right do x z token game earn tokens 
366690,since wen non fungible token token  ?  issuing nfts token issuance arw reducing supply guess incentivising secondary market fractionalized nfts probably nan nft governed dao tokenless daona tokenless dao formed wallet addresses has way ponderate different commitment members therefore becomes inefficient 
366689,could anyone introduce someone wallet connect  ?  interested v2 
366687,buzzed bears have struct lobster born last year

366681, think ' dealing spectrums categories have idea what ' building know ' never work trad org ever 
366679, would love add 2 cents came idea dao governed nft holders where nft contract owned dao dao controls emissions sales like sort investor board 
366678,1 teams already have token live should look alter emission schedule 
366675,"if ' wan na go exponential should stay "" smaller "" vibes league never make token  ?  "
366674,one thing make dao sustainable financial wise which should always goal 1 another making profits which ' find motivating relevant 
366670,pure revenue stuff never scale enough want grow acquire users go exponentail live 2 margins need create capital have credit debt 
366669, do nt really see reason have token well product makes revenue revenue used dao develop projectpay salaries even invest projects potentially could increase revenue reduce costs project itselfnand governance could used nft 1nft1 vote 
366666, what have experienced completely decentralized ao thoughts n dao develop well token does nt bring revenue imo dao should built around interest contribute order get revenue rather interest contribute order earn tokens token game earn tokens rather develop product nif projects get revenue even bear market much better base make dao even stronger

366427, believe people do learn actually adjustnit s do nt talk much especially talks nt appreciated say least market pumps 
366426, still wonder though why  ?  nnfor first 6 months crypto enough get what important namely exiting market rather partially rebalancing stables nnthe rest secondary 
366423, feel people new crypto do nt understand gain knowing when leave when enter 
366422,regarding alpha i ve observed quite time interesting phenomenon which logical think nnwe publishing alpha calls several times incoming dumps marketnthe mix onchain social data analyticsnnyet almost one seemed care much even went angrynnafter market crashed analyses get appreciationnsome bought subscriptions wellnnyet real alpha when leave market seems somewhat little discussed even addressednnmost participatants keep looking alpha understanding what when buy which imo totally wrong nninteresting human psychology 
366420, expect fait finances when swipe debit card want vendor bob s soda shop know re swiping card has enough pay soda nnhowever bob does nt need know how much money have bank account total how much ve spent where past should able follow future forever long use debit cardnnidk how got far crypto path wallet side privacy nni suppose s why work stuff product fit brainer really u0001f937u200d 
366419,why profitable trader would even go hassle participating social trading first place  ?  important question which has solved imo 
366418,exactly spot have transparent systems respecting user privacy ' mutually exclusive fact complementary imo one biggest opportunities web3 
366417, think fair point things need transparent things should nt nnie smart contract verify looking looking code see s going operate expect critical nnbut does nt mean balance should public participate crypto markets 
366382,one point note though privacy oftentimes used synonymously intransparency privacy enhanced tech blockchains adopting showing us seems common misconception which also led lot larger corporates jump bandwagon aping idea private blockchains thinking privacy established reintroducing opaque closed systems 
366363,exactly 100 key privacy protects gains stance self adjudication what others see mission critical adversarial markets 
366356,yeah renaissance has consistently bringing 66 annualised returns 30 years basically have done incredible job leaking info outsiders 
366348,3ac leaded market lts ok long lead push price alone 69k without support problem start when market leads 
366345,even it s alpha it s trade secrets right  ?  how charge mgmt performance fee when people copy trade everything do  ?  
366344,so like battle isnt hard when have element privacy nni also dont buy isnt alpha there s people lead market nnie renaissance technologies alpha shop long ass time tradfi nansen thing back day would dudes have made gains  ?  think 
366343,or maybe wan na shop otc order flow need unload big block do need world see  ?  idk nni think way onchain analytics work bit perversion price discovery 
366342, s great debate right  ?  s importance getting people bandwagon do nt want get way getting nnonchain analytics makes tough heavily tracked folks buy position 
366341, dont believe alpha every trade another independent battle gurantee work always 
366340,that s tricky wonder how much liquidation hunting based know fund xyz size size 
366339,yeah why come trade strat when subscription service alpha  
366337,maybe have mechanism preventing liquidation hunt  
366336, s real problem ecosystem what re nnthe shelf life creative alpha short defi 
366335,the real question how add size dox alpha chain analytics firms plying sophisticated analysis nnanyone size anyone good strats getting rekt nansen 
366334,at crypto right enough liq even top traders how add funds without enough volume wise risk management 
366332,well high certainty trade signal really ' have incentive share would expect marke information get incorporated market prices regardless telling everyone however ' incentive share pseudo trade signals ' motivation get folks ape turn trade signal self fulfilling prophecy 
366327,not necessarily cfe burry s short tesla big trades where you re rewarded talking book people jump trade benefit 
366324,successful traders platforms get cut profits others make copying trades right  ?  ' effectively way successful traders have hedge fund without one get deploy capital strategies get cut profits

359371, presented low risk yield people whom others considered professionals etc saying right s how things works 
359370,that s argument argument big reputable retail figures space shilled intensively have influencer quarter million people following said it s riskfree it s one case among others nnas llama said cant expect retail do dd want adoption 
359367,this dumb new fresh money entered cycle has low understanding fundamentals usually comes literally people earth looks someone better field review 
359362,this stupid argument lunaust marketed reasonably safe investments saying retail should have done dd makes sense when biggest firms got caught pants shit show 
359359, retail when luna going  stay poor criticize luna n retail when bottom fell help i m innocent 
359358,this where marketing kicks brandolini law action 
359355, scams do nt get anywhere one puts money 
359354, think one fault does nt mean innocent otherwise let s make biggest scams market retail safest investment blame retail aping 
359353,kinda funny how apparently ever innocent retail somehow always able do research rekt somehow never put money contract people unironically think they re entitled riskfree profitmaking endeavors refuse cant bothered read 
359350,retail degen knows nothing want ape become billionaire overnight retail important consider ethically speaking average joe wants face inflation has invested ust stablecoin label 
359349,retail would get rekt anyway luna without imo 
359347,people bought luna when supply going trillions 
359346,you d surprised how deceitful have talking collateralizing stablecoin displaying ust usd terra protocols see alice even fully presenting risks nnuxd algorithmic well yet clearly state insurance fund goes 0 funding rates negative they re rekt kind transparency important ust clearly explained risk didnt try sell idea fact usd yield wouldnt have much retail rekt death spirale 
359345,we entire cycle crap put death spiral even people believed ust luna blows mind how stupid herd 
359344,and everything failure dedicated cycle pump dumping algorithmic stable coins which died like basis cash forks 
359343,true still remember when flat design became thing x logos 3d hard use multiple supports x 
359342, ca nt see working what ust terra when comes marketing tldr do nt want learn evil way marketing stables lol 
359341,because crypto giant casino point time world driven marketing every field have noticed massive quality reduction even quality brands switch minimalistic design fits everyone special characters valued marketing what drives sales 
359339, ll add probably curiosity making dashboard know which stablecoin monitor benchmarking purposes working stablecoin x 
359338, do nt think adoption come marketing still used predatory way re literally using similar branding casinos usdd usdn cults ust mim focusing profitsyield instead safetyfunctionality 
359336,for reference would interesting see ust well widely labelled stablecoin time interval 
359328,yeah when project spectacularly implodes ' whole bunch intransparent stuff going founder ' do utmost clear protect reputation ' anything shady going

359281,hey guys nnwhat would easiest way obtain univ3 historical pool states large scale hundreds pools since inception  ?  do know tool  ?  official graph seem work poorly ticksnthanks advance 
359278,yep miss liquidity pool amount trade right  ?  sure what say 
359277, calculate looking what liquidity pool looked like trade s enough info events construct 
359276, given trade ll see least two events sync event which liquidity pool end trade swap event which actual inputs outputs 
359275, uniswapv2 descendants have outputs ll have do reasonable amount legwork make sure case 
359274,because every protocol have different set events andor onchain outputs 
359272, ' currently looking pancake swap transaction made think could useful blockchain 
359271, which protocol  ?  txhash could number different onchain dex s tools

359242, vecrv mcapfees year 2 would give better picture 
359241,that pe seems btw should calculating mcap vecrv circulating fdv 
359239,holding crv cool way get bailout ofc use why someone want hold question 
359231,pe healthy though what calc  ?  
359228, would happy chat dm whenever re available 
359224,interested know ' working interest rate futures system sounds like could overlap 
359217, end day someone has lose does nt matter how much math word play use 
359216,have looked swaap finance polygon  ?  claim help heavily reduce il matrix market maker approach 
359214,you could always lp across group pools wanted diversify 
359212,but why would socializing risk good idea 
359211,v21 sought socialize il risk across pairs actually could have worked fees uni unfortunately entire country went bankrupt 
359204,bancor v2 turned massively gameable launched bancor v21 which turned massively dilutive launched bancor v3 which turned out... 
359203, feel like year bancor comes feature claiming have done impossible weeks later announces feature has shut turned impossible 
359201,we walked could run u0001f972nnbut yeah that s also true it s something needs change think something has pressure community cant future finance shit hits fan everyone goes lol tough shit 
359196, have even really experienced crypto have nt gone complete 0 atleast  ?  tbh agree mismatch what dev expects users aware what actually aware does nt help loudest influencers have idea beyond superficial stuff do nt want discuss stuff wo nt pump bags 
359195, depends vertical well see reason ca nt have 1294837 mildly successful lending protocols survive years have winner takes view dexes 
359192,imo competitor protocol vertical has emerged clear winner 
359190, think s partially marketing partially devs expecting everyone people know things do guess exclusive either see sentiment though getting rekt kind rite passage times marketing types ve encountered barely able explain understand risks s entirely founders recognize push users better educated 
359189,when devs stop something  ?  
359188,when declare protocol obsolete  ?  im deeply triggered il pause 
359187,well part problem marketing sole focus growth costs means turn blind eye when have users comes system without ever fully understanding what participating 
359186,which another problem kinda reveals crypto there s lot winknod dyor clearly messaging lostnnalso there s lot honour system play give ppl ability do shit dont want do someone gon na do 
359185, ve working experimental pool types hope have simulationsactual data show soon nice see market pushing innovative products extreme 
359183,lol bancor tg people accusing team leveraged trading liquidity have understand what risk even managing 
359182, course s lot finagling do when market good sorta works andre tried d say bancor especially paired dex thorough attempt sure why certain people kept claiming never mentioned certain things andor tried redefine funny terms when everything pretty laid nnbut does nt work re trying solve leg broken car when problem nt cars break legs have legs let car leg 
359177, believe equilibrium point which lp would accept risk il behalf lps wish have exposure il terms agreement underlying yield enough cases compensate potential losses considering swap yields right should result competitive rates sides 
359176,it s really risk problem it s even problem it s people trying eat cake have want able profit providing liquidity lose nothing liquidity used liquidity 
359169, well why nt migrate everyone v3 remember bunch hype around 
359163,we left uncomfortable decision letting play do something 
359161,if withdrawals processed organic way protocol would have able handle 
359157, clear means would normally get say 50 tkn 50 bnt get 50 tkn bnt  ?  n decide withdraw il compensation disabled that s correct nlol basically bancor rugged  ?  protocol insolvent  ?  
359153,crypto printer go brrr why reinventing wheel  
359147,doesn ' seem have relevance 
359141,so do need daos anymore  ?  
359140,if ' small message showcase maybe small link 1 sentence why ' unique oke ser 
359137, next should implement negative interest rate unmoved coins people nt using bitcoins nt contributing adoption bitcoin course need maintain 21m 21m airdrop bitcoins negative interest people actually using bitcoin

359107,what want seems show user call contractfunc a1 a2  ?  
359106,which what wallets already do regular transactions 
359105,at extreme could even use raw hex calldata param decode outside 
359101,get also fine btw guess question why concern making look nicer  ?  
359099, would use post json payload said discuss part  
359097,low level example languages have sort uri encodedecode functionality allows take url change value param1 get new urlnin pretty approach lose semantics what argument called cant do operations 
359096, do nt forget thus far one authorized parties burned usdd 
359095,how would make look nicer what kinda tooling  ?  
359093, 1 also would nt play well lot http tooling btw 
359087,param1valueparam2value2 look like nested structure which what path supposed represent which different mental modal what actually mean 
359085,how come  ?  
359084, 1 does nt really make much sense path semantics least params part 
359083, like geth rpc api call get request let s argue should post get would prefer nn1 mainnetgetfuraiov1ethcall0xcontractaddrselectorparamtypeparam1paramtypeparam2returnvalue1returnvalue2nnornn2 mainnetgetfuraiov1ethcall  ?  contractaddr0x selector0x paramtype1uint256 param1123 paramtype2string param2fkc returntype1uint256nn  ?

359073, where s demand coming  ?  still synth markets  ?  lyra smth else 
359057,does usdd work exactly ust  ?  minting burning trx usdd 
359055, think talks dont work aave ihave idea 
359054,so how do denominate eth position  ?  
359052, anyways do nt want clog chat do nt take attack lol 
359051, seems weird have market price 880 which would similar elsewhere re talking 895 oracle 
359049,there nothing aave eth insolvency defi idk where people dig 
359048, u could pull data contract every instance 
359047,chainlink oracles also look 1 exchange multitudes avoid cases where 1 data point fails 
359043,it ' eth oracle oracle really update should have basically overthepricetick kinda 
359038,how liq avoided  ?  still confused 
359032,stop weird shit w ur ponzis sers okay lobsterdao kingdom kinda u scream do trading ' polluting sowwy 
359019,every one investors has 1000 bags stop thinking investors do work pleb thinking helpful end day advice also ignored core devs 
359017,wdym boss  ?  chainlink does liquidate anyone unless providers run liquidations bots which should ' appear apparent far 101 hf position relevant chainlink functioning anywsy

359012,when extradited back us 
359010,anyone knows how assange would charged  ?  
359004, one house becoming brothel does nt mean benchmark house need better nuances conscience 1mn voting fake dao defining how 270mn wallet should behave commit broad daylight robbery 
359003, take money deter future villains placing system risknnit s way educating users what expected behaviornnwin win 
359001,returning ownership money rightf excuse former owner means potentially putting future protocol risk bad whale might do even use money set low liquidity dump fund 
358999, whale decided cause cascading liquidation send sol 0 onchain s strategynnbut due bad code community decide deny profit making strategy  ?  nnkinda selfish  could 3ac trying earn back 1 trade 
358998,and gunna do otc liquidation maybe do like hits price  ?  
358997, think bigger whales should dump solana liq point ensure gets liquidated dao get 
358994,if anything should find liquidation price where slippage would without doubt fuck filling order 
358992, do nt get how liquidate someone when liquidation price 
358990, course do nt 
358989, actually dont think thats crazy thing let happen 
358988, have determined bad whale putting system risk ca nt have like imagine what would happen people nt vote time right  ?  
358987,or whatever things would okay 
358986,and everyone could eat 20 
358985,funny thing doubt would like idk 20  ?  throwing guesstimate gap 
358983,how much value get simply names front page  ?  nntends bring crowds even when vcs clearly net negative every aspect 
358979,want take guess which vcs detracted value  ?  
358978,they consider checks notes liquidation working always has flips page risk bad debt squints has existed platforms older solana 
358974,what genius 
358967,do like vcs experience lending protocol like share knowledge sth 
358964, lol s what essentially 
358961,what scenario lol 
358958,funny how require new code deal 
358953,why allow loan  ?  
358951, well should nt come liquidity solution instead taking account  ?  
358946,it does fail carry actions though 
358936, nt do vote what main risks concerned  ?  recouping  ?  bad debt red  ?  something worse  ?  
358935,if want try whataboutism should least put effort 
358933,yeah maybe rally never let liquidation hit tbh eth has billions liquidity dexes 150 million should theoretically fine 
358931,because gon na critical should critical 
358930, chainlink ca nt even liquidate people when should multiple times 
358927, also ll liquidate someone what 10 price  ?  
358926,as long dont hold ethereum different standards

363270, let s cut feel bad spamming room another iteration do nt think disagree much have new things say 
363269, i ll say what i ve said times consider coddling retail treating adult babies entitled riskfree profitnndevs naive enough think talk community save toxicity naive like you ve said unless first happens naivety remain 
363268,eh insinuating toxicity which almost exclusively tethered price due able build worthwhile community questionablenn tmelobsterschat356183 
363265, different discussion how deal toxic community members nt denying existence

363260, man would literally come w new definitions go therapy 
363259, yes naive 3 weeks ago brought people saidinsinuated wrong included nnfwiw yes probably misunderstand what s talked 
363253, does nt even make sense face thisnn enmwikipediaorgwikitragedyofthecommons 
363252,tbh have idea what point i m saying projects first let retail close muh toxicity failed do due diligence what get using excuse exit isnt problem first since 2022 
363251, um ahem maybe curse experience agree s rational think single project where true one 
363250, why even have decentralized financial system instead what has already working centuries  ?  point people need manage greed gambling point entering new system s reasonable expectation make acquainted new rules instead expecting everything ultimately do nt want greed gambling restricted others do nt know how manage 
363249,people generally dicks internet where risk punched face non existent 
363248,yes it s safe say expecting people change unreasonable accurate we re expecting people change there s expectation people behave civily already do day day lives 
363247,nobody arguing token holders cant get expect get rich sure why insinuate anyone isnnthe people arguing anyone shouldnt get rich coincidentally retail comment matter noteworthy 
363244, mean worked bank upon time beyond irate customers sometimes shitty behaviours dont ever recall receiving end level nonsense say didnt happen nowhere near level happens crypto i m sure argument has weight people have demonstrated capable controlling it s weird whatever reason seems get pass crypto like haha that s crypto 
363243,no claiming anything also trying get argument highlighting ' rational assumption token holders also users lot smart teams know exactly how utilise tokens bootstrap user base 
363242, expecting people behave like have centuries always unreasonable crypto nt magically going fix greed gambling 
363241, expect crypto different traditional finance gatekeeping invest project does nt match expectation instead expecting people take responsibility what buying reasonable imo instead telling devs use private funding 
363240, save network tokens where almost everyone user virtue needing pay gas fees claiming s dapp where mere token holders do nt outnumber users least 51  ?  
363239,this strange what would count sufficient data  ?  
363236, clarified what meant get  ?  
363234,bull tokens go tokens good nbear tokens go tokens bad why do things even need token anyways 
363233,why arguing strawmen  ?  
363231,without accurate data ' claim otherwise what claiming token holders usually have vested interest also users dapp user also translate buying vision dapp project 
363227, reason people launch tokens want make money s always upside creator intend take money general public have deal 
363226, mean make argument side ca nt handle risk volatility early stage projects should nt buy 
363221, mean satoshi made lot money does nt sell does nt mean ai nt rich 
363216, do nt really want dive andre situation s satoshi made quite bit money even constantly larping opposite 
363213, wish could say re right unfortunately s case people claw faces tiny bit power feel comfortable enough consistently bite heels money unfortunately amplifies problem 
363211, honestly retail term does nt make sense should clueless investor 
363207, consider what andre also raising money retail context does nt matter whether do intially let join later exit liquidity 
363203, s point do nt get issue do nt raise directly indirectly retail s emotional responses people clearly fit make investment decision 
363202,consider fact screenshot essentially paraphrase andre s comment didnt raise money anyone nn community bullshit theory follows someone has token best interest do whatever increase value token how naive guess partly fault defi community calling governance tokens people want do govern trenches helping fight instead throne dictator simply shouting orders plebian developers need execute ' care protocol ' care would soon sell token when longer think contributing enough standards ' try add value happy spending endless hours time asking updates explain detail thought processes endless back forth pointless menial topics governance community kill innovation development ' do 
363200, d like think a16z does nt send rape threats portfolio companies s difference 
363197, sorry nt mean address project s raise bull suddenly close when stuff gets toxic 
363195,another thing lack domain knowledge expecting aaa game within year two starting development lack awareness retail has idea what early development product looks like hence piles unrealistic demand teams deliver something price pump 
363194, would noteworthy behavior peculiar projects raised money randoms internet nt 
363193,nobody surprised i m sure where think anyone actually people vent receiving end toxic behaviour sometimes bit empathy simple damn sux enough 
363192, argue regulators have different agenda claim s truth idea average person nt able make informed rational decision when comes investments s either kind stuff re discussing would nt happen know unpopular take ca nt have ways 
363191, sure saying s fully fault retail either s incompatiblilty general retail outside crypto hears project has survived s initial days where s reasonable expectation successful bringing expectation crypto unrealistic 
363190, do understand constant surprised reaction around something s known ages internet easy place toxic money brings worst people 
363189, argue people should nt behave certain ways fully agree people always like 
363184, entitled riskfree profit making should feel bad denying also you re allowed profit comlunitee 
363183, problem normies crypto want upside early risky investments without downside project has give huge return else s scam 
363182,sorry ' going plenty folks love grift space when ' reach profit fame expect exploiting others filter noise 
363181, know unfortunately s one thing when get couple randos peanutgallery existing s another when s group actively trying mess livelihood

362059, do nt see how would safe redeploy contract many times opposed simply deploying using 
362056,already dealt result long upgrade process ensure hacks would far difficult pull n complexity steal value rather 1 which pretty good valuestorage systems go said appreciate feedback  
362053, sandboxed counterfactual storage systems rely selfdestruct effectively function removed create2 nt changed revert existing contracts would brick system 
362051,the code already live has use months 
362049,btw why do need selfdestruct  ?  omit selfdestruct part 
362047, have lots different blogs newsletters compendium may helpnn sovsnotionsiteblogsnewsletterse23cccd322ef4ab8af0014fea0c3bc7c 
362042,so question should asking verkle tree worth bricking contracts whether ' flaw ethereum superfluous imho 
362038, nobody s saying should 
362037, s like saying should get rid delegatecall upgradeble contracts used rug 
362036,breaking one use case would likely necessitate breaking 
362035, kind interesting re looking metamorphic contracts disdain when contracts use mechanism although nt metamorphic 
362033,people cry cruft things like windows js which would much rather twist elaborate pretzels knowingly going ahead bricking functioning programs oops unexpected interaction 
362030,because lowlevel change bricks least one valuestorage system isnt exactly good look particularly when none done desire exploit anything - increase security 
362029,in case perhaps should consider changes behavior create2 well 
362026, far know eip still draft seems like people want things change does nt appear foregone conclusion 
362025, dont think true give promise understandble things have change 
362023, certainly do nt think anyone used system assumption evm might make changes made value inaccessible 
362022,perhaps should do away apparent farce immutable contracts knows what unexpectedness needing hardfork discover future eh  ?  
362021, fair assumption methods allowed value stored accessed would nt change feet 
362015,on supposedly immutable platform building what should immutable contracts  ?  
362011, create2selfdestruct never intended pattern fact abuse hole design should nt prevent closing said hole 
362010,this almost equivalent permanently locking liquidity uniswap v1 when rage left dead v2 v2 getting rekt v3 though fortunately v3 didnt go expected department almost it s worse 
362009,even auditors have started recommending selfdestructing clone pattern how secure 
362008,exactly why bad eip 
362005, would nt able implement check avoid redeploy somewhere else  ?  
362001, applications affected change use breaks where contract recreated address using create2 selfdestruct 
361999,if contract already exists address selfdestruct has bricked create2 reverts iirc 
361997,process quite simple predict new contract location using create2 determinism send tokens contract address contract exploit when ready withdraw deploy contract address retreive tokens call selfdestruct save gas 
361996, do understand please explain how eip bricks alot money  ?  
361992,how does brick alot money  ?  according eip sendall still used retrieve funds 
361987,benefit whom  ?  
361986,the important question do needs production environment outweigh needs many good sir  ?  
361985,would like see ever implemented production environment uses create2selfdestruct loops heavily sandbox value storage ' see actually implemented knowledge benefits former practice spread 
361983,when eip getting implemented though 
361978,which would break metamorphic smart contracts 
361975,they should rebrand usdo already

361821, re copy pasting address could get screwed 
361817,why would people send transactions without 0x  ?  
361814,not sure why longer adds 0x says invalid address something seriously wrong

346487,so people want open short positions chain would prefer something use collateral

346386,as said have see actual code know whether particular way better worse 
346385, suppose have written words realized talking revert likely case checking bunch things true one nt revert case think re right short circuiting leads us revert which point cares whether wasted gas ands 
346384,if would benefit short circuiting should end 
346383,the case which save anything operands already loaded really sequence ands final check value 
346381,because compiler should generate code goes false exit else b false exit else b c false exit else revert 
346378, b false do nt need do c s jumpi 
346375, think even case nonreverts big require should still cheaper jumpi costs 10 gas costs 3 gas like said specific example needed 
346374,yeah people gon na look ust say algosbad bad may could hardly design better trojan horse fiatcoins various glorified wrappers somehow top 10 3 
346373, well yes change come quickly unexpectedly current paradigm has help 80 years does nt mean change extremely rapidly right would cause lot instability though 
346372, reasonable branch prediction have started speculatively executing based assumption require sanity check revert should nt even really lose cachepipeline except exceptional case which point already going spend bunch extra resources processing revert 
346371, another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto nnwe ll dead true beyond shillfluencer narratives even doesnt happen bigger things worry should happen 
346370, s code re jumping which has nonzero cost terms size cache locality afaik jump instructions do cost differing amounts gas based absolute value program counter incrementdecrement 
346369, condition evaluates false do nt execute expensive revert logic including string return etc 
346366,honestly ' need exact code figure thing besides actual revert instruction ' also returning error string logic which far expensive booleans evaluations 
346365, makes sense yet time s odd thing attempt re trying hedge away risk systems dollar side inflation cefi systems issue government instability crypto side instability crypto systems continues issue one perspective crypto extremely volatile relative usd another perspective usd extremely volatile relative crypto eventually line crossed where people see usd volatile relative crypto likely onchain assets primary reference point point ve suddenly gone optimizing cryptobased risk needing optimize fiatbased risk s really difficult balancing act strike properly

369334, daos best rehash shares onchain practice much worse name complete misnomer nnno one would unironically call companies shareholders decentralized virtue shareholders yet people space have somehow convinced there s magic decentralization juice onchain replica concept 
369331,could someone share link ethsecurity tg chat  ?  
369327,it hyperstructure meta hyperstructure have shareholders 
369326, okay have different definitions centralization re describing hyperstructure granted do nt think even uniswap would fit definition since have fee switch 
369324, mean prety dope tech do have implicit trust assumption oracle relayer regardless whetther colluding 
369323,are saying dao have control whether contracts work centralization  ?  
369319, shortterm perhaps really long ownership has power given dao s dao choosing agents have emergency powers exercise necessary people misbehave dao remove 
369316, does nt layerzero have precrime  ?  nnlikely helps somenn mediumcomlayerzeroofficialintroducingprecrime49bef4a581d5 
369314,then have something explicitly centralized 
369308, require disabled disabled nnthis line should somewhere pretty much every contract where external transactions starts give power ton people break require governance unbreak better someone abuses power halt protocol stuff like happen unabated 
369307,this interesting thanks though ' always impression nomad has months old given tech complexity ' unreasonable think needed time proven 
369306, nice service would mev replayer aggressively frontruns tx results stolen money nnnot trivial thing do ' sure ' get tons funding usage 
369305,breakglass procedures need standardized defi should always failsafe switch 
369303, nomad protects roninhorizon style attacks where root trust compromised nnit also protects large category implementation issues example near rainbowbridge which uses optimistic model like nomad stopped potentially massive attack when watchers noticed attack disconnected bridge nnhowever case attack come transactions went bridge exploit contracts ethereum means watcher model halts system event something goes wrong nt able utilized 
369298, get what ' saying levering unproven software also has obvious risks 
369296,would argue should stop building rollups go sidechains small validator sets instead  ?  
369291,it bears stressing nomad has far strongest economic security model bridge construction however system vulnerable implementation risk 
369287,moonwell could another victim blindly using chainlink tbhnnget cheap bridge assets supply system counts full pricennstopping blockchain may have least prevented drain native assets 
369285,ty dont know how missed lol 
369282,do think glmr team total has much liquid assets moonwell dapp funds gone purposes sorry speculation frustrated 
369279,what ' interesting ' still producing blocks 0 txs wonder how executed 
369275,unless have plan place big doubt 171m supply 80m borrow moonwellfi 
369274, arjun connext nnwe re fast executionliquidity layer nomad connext currently does nt use nomad rails yet users connext nt directly affected nnthat said mad assets obviously risk routers provide liquidity xchain transactions holding madassets moonbeam milkomeda evmosnnwe reached routers approx 75 mins ago let know disable support chains protects folks sending mad assets get native assets another chain nnhowever s nothing done madassets already held routers currently approx 33m 
369271, looked couple exploit transactions calldata basically every time except destination address s probably how spread 
369270,cause funds definitely white hatted question how much how long takes retrieve 
369269, quite astonishing m really new how do hackers see what methods hacker using blockchain  ?  
369266, sorry do nt see paused period  
369262, simply replacing address calldata message nt get validated could do per address lots people jumped 
369257,that what trying find evmos could dump native assets 
369256,do have right hackers jumped seeing exploit  ?  
369255,how pause chain  ?  
369250,apparently could reuse successful bridging receipts 
369249,compound billion dollar protocol big treasury still got hackednndevs probably have blame easy raise 22 woe betide 
369248,yeah mostly curious what happened dumb typo kind bug genius keccak spoofing thingy 
369247,if fundraise 22m should hard expand team improve quality code 
369246,glmr chain paused last tx 52 minutes back moonscanio nmy friend able do anything even though knew exploit 
369245,although sure why usdc wasnt frozen guess would have wait autopsy 
369240, think rari capital exploiter might have made 
369234, able rescue small amount seeing transactions think others have lot send back s why m asking should setup address where could send back whatever amount able save 
369233,should wait comms official account imo 
369229,keeping should safer sending nomad team 
369226,where should one send rescued funds back  ?  
369215,so have liquidity evmos probably unbacked 
369210,how much drained  ?  
369204,why isnt pause bridge yet  ?  
369203,when bridge another chain cases youre exchanging locked assets different bridges

369022,"my friend faced "" almost successful "" attack have anyone experienced  ?  "
369020, when said nothing change mean like underlying mechanism how achieve stability altered well contracts how macro outlooks merge well possibility pow fork affect m sure debate do agree tho yes s quite likely assets pow fork chain become worthless esp since exchanges nt willing prepped accept assets 
369019,even could get something nothing 
369018,yeah true unless started similar pricing gave time lusd redemptions collateral value backing would get smoker 
369017,the question pow eth would valued 23 pos eth how much would lusd worth pow network 23 cents  ?  
369012,so eth collateral functioning oracle pow fork lusd could still have value 
369009,sorry what meant haha ' mean collateral ratio meant type collateral 
369005,only stablecoins could work chains simultaneously would 100 eth backed stablecoins imo course would need functioning oracle 
369004,yeah pretty much way work stablecoin issuer decide which chain honor redemptions

368960,how do generate new wallet 
368951,nothing how stables fundamentally operate change postmerge along every contract currently use how affects overall stablecoin market terms positive market outlook different question debate 
368950,hey thought would share report wrote merge impact capital flows mev miners forks moren twittercomskatensurfstatus1553558558368677888

368922,you have place discuss game like group something  ?  
368914, nbut yeah regarding file vault every time u do fresh install macos creates new set keys rendering old set useless anyways 
368912,not sure though disk encrypted ' slightly better position paranoia would definitely make sense store assets hardware wallet direct manufacturer seed phrase never leave device transactions create hot wallet transfer subset tokens accept bad shit happen 
368910,if u delete disk utility startup screen do fresh install reinstall ' difference nnthen should safe

368903, pretty sure re fine rather destroying macbook would nt better move assets brand new wallet new seed  ?  
368901, yeah agree well do nt see chain solves what trying do

344263, see makes lot sense 3 steth staking apy s unlikely convex pool which gets extra emissions has stable apy receives trading fees would drop apy threshold 
344262,so dont like feature  ?  simply dismiss see people finding reasonable using ape pools low probability apy staying level 
344256,how does do  ?  source available somewhere  ?  
344252,but ser how else number go  ?  
344251,in case something closer proof capital which founders traded token supply marketing 
344250,tvl apy protocol name enough imho aggregated chart looks dope nwhy would need probabilities  ?  would rather keen know what s averagemedian reatail position size 
344249,has anyone kept aftermath 80 million dollar bean exploit chance  ?  
344247, clarify model does nt predict prices apy predicts probability current apy hold small forward looking window 
344246, reason defi founders have large spike tvl start creates massive bug bounty protocol doesnt get hacked signals everyone protocol trusted trust lasts forever since assertion security smart contracts 
344245,and whats alternative ml model case would  ?  probability describes confidence forecast case llama believe easier use sort model describe relationships variables rather manually handcraft estimates something using model case provides scalability generalization 
344242,exactly why think crazy teams set high apy distributions early days launch give majority supply handful degens prepared take risk have little likelihood sticking around long term 
344238, almost every crypto participant also able tell usually when product launches apy high high risk untested lot people do nt want risk time goes product doesnt get hacked apy goes downnnthis simple prediction yet proves possible predict apy stability 
344237, tbh do nt get why people find strange actually really easy tell naively whether apy drop example when aave launched polygon easy tell 2030 apy would nt last long since trusted platform battle tested sure enough lasted daysnnyou apply logic masterchef pools launch see spike apy drops predicting things like quite easy do nt see why should issue train model 
344229, nt pool apy higher order form stock return  ?  have doubt could learn constants pool formula data does nt give much predictive power 
344228,"with "" random guessing "" referring benchmark which model ' predictions evaluated ultimately hard say how good mode without seeing outofsample predictions "
344226,why would someone make random financial decision tho majority aping larger pool based reputation 
344225,any model would far perfect ' pretty confident would possible significantly outperform random guessing devil details success effort depends features modeling approach principle should much easier forecast future pool apys something like stock returns tho 
344224, see transfer transferfrom methods would say yes 
344223,one main challenges information resource asymmetry participants have insider information simply money which generates massive randomness model model obviously aware information 
344222, could see machine learningpredictive modeling useful ' means expert farming ' think features like pool age tvl apy relative similar pools would fairly predictive stability pool new high apy compared similar pools would expect apy converge market rate 
344217,for example changes tvl last 2 weeks pretty low apy stays same... otherwise tvl increases predict how much changes later understand how affects apy 
344212,mmm where documentation relating  ?  could pretty problematic didnt see anything docsllamafi 
344210,great way know how farm taxes away

344170, dying going anywhere either crowded market euphoria wearing token launches do address underlying issue better competitors pie shrinking every day launching token going hurt retail when ape get dumped onnndefi protocols do nt need tokens 
344169, personally like governance approach re taking sure would enough revive beneficial 
344165,optimism has lower tvl harmony ffs hop 110th stargate die already

341209, ryan network cartelnnyou well things built network cartelized therefore something hope irrelevant what re saying

341173,have done anything note worthy recently  ?  seem do lose market share 
341170, think what see compound governance much centralized what going cosmos even individual chains

341165,let ' see what a16z come uni 
341164,just take look osmosis governance real busy have great turnout

341150,ok why fail 
341140,what 
341137,why would unstake 
341135,why does matter loop irrelevant wont even enter sender staker 
341134, dont get issue 
341132,where loop 
341129,which function  ?  
341122,this why say ibc need trust chains running 
341120, 23 eth valset would have sign state transition invalidated ibc connection 
341119,but regardless love what ' buddy pleasure always  3 ' sure ' see twitter thread shortly haha 
341116,nor should would affect validity connection 
341112,you have trust chains transacting 
341109, have previous validator set verify validator set nt change trust threshold state transitions 
341108,how does contract cosmos side verify validity next block 100 certainty vice versa ethereum 
341106,no would invalid state transition 
341104,and world where relayers malicious write false header forged chain  ?  
341099,we have cosmos light client 
341095,we have eth light client run cosmos side 
341094,anyway got ta run -- ' have fun  
341093, bls precompiles should nt bad 
341092,but yes hypothetically could 
341090,it could 
341087, verify headers do nt need trust relayers 
341083,this what mean terminology confusion ser -- what ' arguing application specific risk vs risk trust root ' arguing trust root fails escrowed assets rugged -- truennbut affects tokens need maintain supply peg whether wrapping transport layer mint burn 
341082,you have trust chains transacting 
341077, know would haha 
341075,see would disagree w impractical current systems 
341073,but jackzampolin clear ' straightforward forever think light client model best current model ' impractical current systems gas chains reduced factor 100010000 would absolutely implement validation library have default everything 
341071,what do mean  ?  wrapped assets carries standing risk stargate carries static risk 
341064, would say yes obviously disagree 
341058,you ' 100 correct escrow risk persists indefinitely post settlement layer transfer two questions n1 how do get exposure assets like eth have supply peg mainnet  ?  need representational asset capitalize pools liquidity network like stargate right  ?  unless ' ever expecting fully native deployments like usdc which permissionless tokens ' offer n2 what ' flagging application risk smart contract performs escrow function bulletproof does apprehension go away  ?  
341057,so issue wrapped assets clearly carries risk post transactionnnie tx x b risk transaction also entire duration b exists nnso have 20b outflow insert total wrapped flow chain chain b have 20b standing risk forever ' unwrapped meaning transport like corrupted tx point tx risk end user always carries exposure nnwith something like stargate pay higher premium latent liquidity completely removes standing risk ie 20b outflow chain chain b done without user ever exposed risk outside risk immediate tx without overall system risk ever exceeding amount currently stargate pools 
341056,"agreed what ' solution "" wrapped assets ""  ?  ' seen team criticize what solution generating representational liquidity stargate capitalizes liquidity pools  ?  nnthe point ' making selective use terminology make positioning marketing case ignores still risk -- since agree early industry need help educate vocabulary launder  "
341054,anything across two chains risk underlying transport protocol compromised nature messaging why work improving validation mechanisms interesting 
341053,do see fundamental technical obstacles implementing something like ser  ?  ' have visibility twitter ' hard get feedback

370126,which entirely different selfexecuting function 
370124,this wrong what 
370123,no idea what ' talking  
370122, what ve described keepers which exist what think ve described does nt exist 
370121,of course automate parts protocol external callsbots almost everyone does 
370120,clearly evm level ' outcome users which really what matters 
370119, does nt 
370118,yes basically does 
370114,automation number points failure separate points ya do 
370111,if selfexecuting functions based event would indeed need 
370110, contracts ca nt call decide do job ve done create nicelooking single point failure 
370109,you do need 3rdparties though 
370108,yeah original solution used keepers lolnnyou do auction reward mechanism account gas costs 
370106, s what keepers which exist least count dedicated parties know willing pay gas regardless network situation 
370105,actually yeah make poke function pays calls first need do fancy contractssetups long enough people know free money opp 
370104,you do sort mev baiting botskeepers 
370102,so u could basicly write eth3x fund coin example decentralized

370100,if what saying possible keepers wouldnt exist 
370096,that ' why keepers

369969,but would also acting best financial interest delegators 
369967, suppose stated way probably right have never shut deliberately does beg question what constitutes deliberate shutdown  ?  
369966, do nt remember instances though previous chain halts due validators overloaded running ram otherwise crashing we -- validators choosing deliberately shut chain 
369961,shut what  ?  mean halt chain  ?  
369955, highly doubt d able get enough people together start censoring txs short period time either -- ve seen how long took get solana back last chain halts 
369952,it possible indeed how should which where decentralized network gets weight thing actually happens solana  ?  
369947,so thing would still possible noncensoring validator include tx

369925,does validator exist  ?  
369920, would miners choosing include txs would nt change anything consensus 
369918,no  ?  why would 
369917, would nt attempting equivalent what led etc  ?

351369, early stage startups get 20m valuations ca nt exit reason valuation may make sense have 10 chance becoming worth 1b 50x return investment highly profitable ofc real numbers different might 01 chance bet does nt make sense s ev 
351367, s important resist conflating businesses different stages which have different players involved different incentives 
351366,just true though nthere bets like magicleap extreme exceptions market has flowing cash past years saying 70b valuation uber made sensenbut overall non web3 businesses pretty easy understand 
351364, eventual profitability important s how businesses valued short term speculation has impact long term does nt hold water revenue metrics business extremely important looking numbers outside provides little insight amount profit company generate next 20 years 
351363, companies have raised billions last years investors do nt have significant amount revenue justify probably except epic does nt even have sustainable revenue model 
351362,there certain irony watching discussion starts disagreeing what essentially there s equation profitability circle back less conclusion digress 
351360,about amazon 8 years ago profitable n wwwbenevanscombenedictevans201494whyamazonhasnoprofitsandwhyitworksn brings us back beginning amazon ' business delivering rapid revenue growth accumulating surplus cash profits every penny cash ploughed back expanding business given business runs permanently loss profits what already spent making new businesses 
351358, s really relevant anything want look regular businesses how operate do 
351357, mean turn around s good far 35b invested extra 500m isnt crazy amounts what crazy how company could raise much sort product market fit highly unusual point company has invested billions r 8 years effort

351353,it reinvesting profits growth which makes lot sense 
351351,part one fixed cost would profitable certain size grew enough would market leader think one partly choice 
351349,amazon wasnt proftiable like 20 years chose many companies something basically public companies have common good revenue likely could profitable wanted vast majority 
351348, whatever ls does nt really seem factor investors 
351342,the end spectrum uber also have insane amount invested tho magic leap example has raised 35 billion without working product 
351341,one reasons forced bnt people do swaps believe 
351340,there 1000s profitable public companies uber extreme end spectrum real point could have chosen profitable long time ago revenue matters cursory glance business outside like pretty meaningless

339810, also oracle pretty much useless pretty sure chainalysis knows what s idea  ?  v2 script relayers track transfers  ?  
339809, may practical every project one way when s nothing strongarm compliance everything else less solves 
339808,having things depend single maintainer could part solution work should also set way allowing churn protect people leaving when things become heated everyone has different perception risks nothing preventing ideas proliferating 
339807,and why keep mentioning liquity 
339806,the protection absolutely anonymous software immutable decentralized possible running sort central twitter account already problematic imho tricky topic basically communication do online matter how small open window identified 
339804,so maintainer basically have absolutely anonymous extent where law enforcement track thats tricky days gets tricky every day 
339803,it easy order able do maintainers need protected otherwise go doubt tornado people aligns vision product 
339802, s easy do nt integrate narcware products do nt have backdoors which abused 
339801,then should clear rebuilding regulations way tolerates products like tornado whole goal get control people recall meaningful reversal regulations opposite direction lets reopen conversation tends become spammy 
339794, mean best way solve problem actually rebuild regulations makes sense provide proof funds whoever asks put jail ' do let ' leave discussions 
339792, yes s exactly what ronin bridge exploiters right blacklisted address transfer eth addresses use tornado 
339791,well use dont need

339783,thats why move kind odd does do anything everyone involved should aware do without canceling whole thing 
339782,it definition regulator compliant does thing regulators handle obfuscation funds 
339781, think tornado should stay regulator complaint though otherwise addresses interacted tornado would banned cexes thus leaving almost easy way stay anonymous still have ability cash money internet cash 
339780, should ve gotten rid inperson leverage ahead 
339778,disgusting what absolutely terrible standard set 
339777,that would form whitelisting basically render whole point tornado obsolete

347767,wait what 
347764,and pretty sure putting governance vote locking people would cause recordtime race exit 
347763,technically do would hardfork chain main issue becomes how wormhole would handle hardfork theory wormhole nonoptimistic bridges tend treat onchain data source truth would trust whatever came chain would come what version truth specific nodes connected would report 
347762, cool s what m looking for 
347761, m 100 certain conditions would take produce invalid update though 
347759, yes theoretically invalid update produced terra could used unlock funds ethereum should nt unlocked 
347758, do nt currently check chain conditions when bridging optimistic bridges check have safety measures protect others currently do 
347757, curious could actually do first 2 even wanted  ?  would nt go similar process compound minting bug  ?  3 nnalso terra anchor team  ?  
347754,would detect terra 51 attacked malicious validators submitted invalid steal wrapped eth bridge back eth transactions terra  ?  
347753,how do bridges work  ?  mean how does smart contract ethereum holding eth bridged terra know whether submitted bridge transactions terra eth valid transactions terra  ?  
347750,deleted what say  ?  
347747,tbh almost every country where profited 150 mill lost year later rekt 
347744,if interchangeable principle would ve started way there s difference 11 collateralized fiatcoin 11 collateralized eth nnthere s also funny fine print coming progressively less liquidity goes far 
347742,well thats problem think agree needs collateral what would good collateral bar fiat backed stablecoins  ?  
347739,interchangeable what  ?  
347735,there s constant storytelling how it ll eventually get rid fiatcoin friends collateral ever actually gon na happen kicking road pacify bagholders anyone may say anything  ?  
347729,sure using super simplified example ' have hurt take worst case super simplified scenario anyway nitpicking nothing wrong post 
347724, yes another thing nt counting event nonpol liquidity withdrawn sold like amo would consistently burn frax keep balance pool within stableswap peg range factor 1500 remaining amount frax left sold minority left compared collateral protocol has left hundreds millions locked liquidity uni v3 etc 
347721,well post says 25b frax existence 155 curve pool 1b sell order possible 3b pool 155 frax 155 3crv nnthe protocol owns 23 15b frax curve pool worst case scenario fudpanic 5b frax 5b 3crv withdrawn pool have 2b pool 1b5b15b sell order 
347719, m sorry like said optimistic adopting fractional collateralized model frax runs which has worked historically like said work lot projects want integrate us make sure integrations do existentially endanger peg case hear overall m also saddened what s happened  
347716, thus has aware many people follow blindly 
347715,don ' have issues how frax protocol works way topic importantrelevant nitpicking since ' used far less transparent comms crypto nnjust feel level endorsement lunaust highly opportunistic crossed red line away integrityresponsibility particularly someone regarded expert matter 
347714,can explain what mean  ?  sure follow right there s 17b frax existence 900m curve pool there s tons locked liquidity uni v3 places well protocol owns 66 entire curve pool 900m frax isnt even circulating 
347713, has lot collateral lot locked liquidity  locked liquiditypol means even fxs go price lot liquidity owned protocol also locked supply market s what try explicitely aim always when designing algo supply s mostly backed though tbh algo supply v small hope s simple enough 
347712,anyway would nice talk simulations post would include worst case scenario which case would dump 15b frax 2b pool instead 1b frax 3b pool described 
347708,please share dummy guide how frax worksnand why it s stable ustnni mean reading wp official materials understand nn frax backed usdc collateral ratio n rest frax sharesnnwhat frax shares going 0 luna  ?  liquidations  ?  hedge  ?  
347706,how much 155b frax curve pool owned protocol  ?  
347705, mean hopeful would able adopt frax model quickly enough get high collateral backing way peg has robust unfortunately nt able time think fact everyone knows stablecoins need collateral one impression have vanilla algo stable design make 
347704,"you really "" ' expect situation ""  ?  ' realize ustluna would one day go zero ' expect happen short term  ?   "
347700, believe frax long sam does say ppls size size 
347699, s lot locked concentrated liquidity uni v3 also vast majority curve pool owned protocol amo should rebalance shortly anyway make weights closer 5050 even weight peg basically exactly parity like said do nt do anything reckless protocol firmly owns vast majority stableswap lp collateral liquidity keep peg  
347698, actually already explained telegram 4pool never intended used dramatically collateral frax terms peg would like worrying usdc s peg s 4pool namely would irrelevant seems like re concerned lps pool actual protocol s pegsolvency which totally separate matter people should see yield worth risk make informed decision launch integrations projects time long does nt directly jeapordize peg frax do nt see reason complain said obviously nt expect situation s beyond disheartening see how much people have lost terra ecosystem s terrible situation around frax though protocol stablecoin fine 
347695,nope curious how different projects explain fundraising goals tokenomics early pitch decks 
347692, would have also frax ' deepest liquidity pool people decide pool going zero would really have threat protocol

363599, agree perfect what though use qortal without sponsored sponsorship entitles minting rewards 
363598, malicious people set should nt hard mount sybil attack which what think meant when mentioned selfsponsorship 
363589,there issue self sponsorship which addressing right 
363588,you mint when get sponsored already existing member 
363585,you verify everything network have access history mempool directly 
363583,the tech works dont focus much opticsmarketing 
363581,this seems pretty hand wavey nn qortalorg nnlacks clear description how ' consensus works 
363579,again running node running validator btc has high bar entry mining node 
363578, have solid tech built like fully onchain decentralized chat neat features

363566,any project which actually has core value  ?  anyone participate without amassing hardware  ?  
363565,it would trivial expensive set baseline arbitrarily high fit even solana well answer different question 
363563,fair still think ' m00t ' like running probabilistic model feasibility transactions fees sustaining bitcoin network when mining rewards end least eth trying do something acknowledges problem 
363561, worse performance requires higher hardware costs which prices users able attain sovereign security model enabled running node nnhis intent pretty clear 
363560, feel like ' kicking tires know eth has massive storage requirements instructions say anyways found bsc one interesting time completed 20 something gb wonder what

363558, know bitcoiners would nt call bad faith lopp starts baseline assumption able run node should easy enough anyone do basic consumer hardware something common circles benchmarks least see simply seeing what conforms 
363554, think s still useful tbh never really know how requirementsrecommendations made sometimes things work even far what s listed requirement 
363552,also blogloppnet2021altcoinnodesynctests want get snapshot time answer what costs run node 
363551,question lenders right default do pay back depositors kind ie eth btc etc do liquidate usd pay back usd  ?  
363550,also calls like ethgetlogs available lot providers resource intensive use case requires might have run node

348614, cr ratio hard asset collateral protocol has total supply frax independent market conditions levels fine cr 70s curve amo have proportionally higher tvl ya could actual runs liquidity everyone saw ust barely pol curve enough btc liquidity model terra s btc collateral basically btcust curve pool controlled amo d see would need 80 pol mixture stablecoinsbtc reliably stay safe do nt think ever got 20 cr unfortunately far m aware maybe someone else better knowledgeable balance sheet could calculate highest cr 
348611,what low enough cr see depends market condition s isnt  ?  nis limitation burning speed  ?  
348610, currently assuming smart contract exploits tetherusdcdai depeg possible way cr 8875 protocol controls enough pol one 3 stablecoins permanently depegs though ya imbalanced additionally low enough cr curve pool could indeed unbalanced sell pressure frax large enough overwhelm protocol controlled liquidity s why frax has conservative algorithmic supply happen levels especially near 90 cr 
348606, samkazemian describe scenario which curve pool balance  ?  
348598,why dxy going when usd printed obscene amounts  ?  
348596, curve amo operates frax3crv pool has exposure usdc usdt dai collateral mixture 3 stablecoins currently tvl amos have created predominantly 2 ways minting algorithmic frax supply protocol operates directing collateral used mint frax protocol curve amo example 1b tvl has control frax3crv lp tokens owns combination minting algorithmic frax pool expansions moving usdc pool users minting frax lending amos like aave purely minted algorithmic frax like dai s direct deposit module 
348595,in curve example specify what tokens 1b tvl curve might  ?  nni ask partly better understand next part where amo someone else sells 200m frax pool amo simultaneously burns 200m frax might mean amo burns different set frax tokens since longer holds 200m sent curve pool right  ?  nnbut original q how does amo have get frax tokens burn first place  ?  nnsame aave example how does amo have get frax burn  ?  nnty 
348591, s pretty simple nnfor curve amos protocol burns frax periodically keep pool balanced deeply peg amo has 1b tvl curve example 200m frax sold curve pool amo burn 200m frax thus have 800m lp control afterwards nnfor lending amos like aave burns frax periodically raise interest rates get borrowers repay frax loans one main mechanisms how cr has gone week exactly designed  
348590,did amo buy burn frax profit falling reduce frax supply  ?  nnor how else could amo have affected quick 13 fall frax supply 25b 15b  ?  nnamo nn1 raise cr also current borrowers  ?  instantly liquidate  ?  cr rise affects future borrowers how have fast effect supply  ?  even current borrowers how drop supply 13 fast especially much frax staked afaiknn2 buy burn yes nn3 lower cr opposite nn4 raising fxs1559 burn rate profits cr 
348589,yes blocks do come orderly important able find opportunities sending

348586,eth has gas

348580,do understand correctly creditbacked proposal frax would something like elaborate lending amo essence  ?

348567,as rwl truefi lending amo goldfinch amo passed governance have deployed come next 2 weeks well 
348566,no around corner fraxlend which got done audited trail bits past monday projects have already reaching us apply credit 
348565,we probably introduce risk metrics based big unlocks could impact protocol stability 
348563, rwlprotocol credit loans has already implemented

348548, correct s enough pol satisfy outstanding frax entirely safe circulating supply earning good yield right obviously do nt want say 100 safe due possible smart contract risks andor tether depegging which unforeseen events assuming steady state things rock solid 
348546,damn like stuff why lp fk me... anyway ask sam print stablez gearbox pools soooooon  blz ser 
348544,but gap algorithmicity exactly what recent proposals sam wan na fix make durable 
348540,or what take break 
348539,this actually should regulate inflation fxs stake holdersnnnot sure where standing 
348529,but cr ratio becomes 100 how fxs token accrual value frax demand  ?  
348528,acquired profits what frax product generating 
348527, think main question arw trying understand what backing 1484b supply godefi right  ?  
348526, ya re right front end does clearly show 1485b frax dashboard appfraxfinance 
348522,fpi 100 cr new peg totally different stablecoin balance sheet should 100 cr like frax started should even conservative opinion fpi peg even harder keep dollar peg since pegged cpi thus inflation resistant 
348516,if like tradfi lingo yes think that s somewhat accurate think accurate say traditional fractional reserve bank where illiquid debt fxs backing algorithmic supply frax aka liabilities bank 
348515,we money market product when increasing cr ratio right  ?  
348513, btw profits nt 12b think mean frax supply 12b profits always 200m sitting around 115m which lot technically lower 
348511,ya frax still 37m positive earnings week which amazingnnq when profits fall half 12b what happened frax supply how  ?  nnig multisig fully controls profits fund 
348505,in coingecko api what do mean  ?  nncosttomovedownusdncosttomoveupusdnnmove how much  ?  
348504, have nt done analysis protocol profits since last week assume frax still one cash flow generating protocols entire defi space even lower 200m revenue yields do nt think s many protocols match frax s revenue generation which weird see fxs hit hard market rn see dashboard average daily income protocol 317kday s 115m annual revenue conditions extremely good shape excelling even markets 
348503, farms frax apr restake apy otherwise auto compounded rewards  ?  nni ask tokens farms ca nt easily claim rewards users ca nt usually hold tokens afaik nnrebase like ohm one option auto compound curious how frax might do 
348500,yes bottom right profits still balance sheet see breakdown where profits top left investor amo 
348496, another example lending amos which similar dai s direct deposit module do count cr overcollateralized maker does 
348495,every amo has extremely conservative way calculating cr which see look source code onchain since open source frax does 0 market operations chain deterministic 
348494,the pol page yes example cr calculated much conservative manner cr curve amo calculated claims 3crv collateral protocol has frax peg breaks cr which means curve pool gets emptied frax 88 nnin reality curve amo close 1 1 redemption frax sellers frax amo rebalances actually withstand 1 1 sell offs entire supply 3crv 
348491, exactly think got intepretted seigniorage capture fxs totally new stablecoin really case re trying improve model make something algostables aspire do s important know frax has pretty much perfect peg since launch do nt want get complacent think endgame design forever re trying improve design algorithmic part supply additionally backed debt 
348489, wouldnt say radically think people really took mean frax changing everything which true making even safer still actually sustainable algorithmic supply frax frax right close 90 backed hard assets enough pol which isnt counted cr cover outstanding frax redemptions thing wanted add proposing algorithmic supply backed creditdebt addition fxs

371066,my smol u0001f9e0 ' understand why alfa ' buy hold eth get ethpow instead complicated borrowing operations pls explain simply retard 
371065,the guy asked what happens get liquidated when borrow eth ' sell protocol sees eth going price eating collateral reality since still have eth always return lose money 
371063,sorry why relevant still  ?  slow 
371061,why would relevat though  ?  
371060,basically have eth ' care what price need give back x eth have x eth wallet times 
371059,if eth pumps hard meanwhile ' lose money still have eth protocol ' know

372374,thanks seems like solid thread why feel necessary delete half including one shared  ?  
372373, wonder reason why dao wo nt vote implementing restrictions similar situation  ?  
372368, nt ignoring issues associated smaller stables know re small difficult scale nnthey re issues projectending risks thoughnnchallenge usdc wrappers yes scale what costs decentralization censorshipresistance nnso think asking questions good especially given threat centralization trust people have placed assets 
372367, isnt nnno isnt why think well carry feel free search grifter you re interestednnas lusd vs fiatcoin wrappers yes dont like either when wrappers try sell something they re tangible benefit fiatcoin wrapping should have one manner liquity without pretendao games 
372366,it s quote tweet defending chainlink relianceimmutability isnt which part earlier pretendao fiatcoin wrapper conversation  case actually have nothing lusd anything do like lot dont like people pointing fair critiques frax dai ignoring fair ones smaller stablecoins that s  
372362,you might want check what word grifter means dictionary means smallscale swindling seeing how lusd barely 12 2 size frax dai respectively one side looks like grifter might want default calling everything else scam next everyone least knows true colors 
372361, s quite similar grifter argument ago dare say virtually identical alas would expect nothing less principal parties involved selling things 
372360,the reality quite simple pointing things bad people have vested interest distracting everyone muddying waters claiming it s strategy have left 
372359,the govt has access chainanalysis pretty silly would take less time filter noise took create 
372354,overall feel like contract approvals used necessary evil proper ux days thought should put example eip would allow data token transfers 
372353,any thoughts folks  ?  would love hear alternative opinions 
372343, well definitely nt scaling exact mechanism nonstop has shrunk time s probably yettobeinvented mechanism possibly 
372342, true far evidence points overcollateralizedonly model what going do might unique innovation new stability mechanism fully decentralized scale billions onchain entirely far evidence does show yet does nt appear overcollatonly model 
372341,again why do think doubling lie answer question  ?  
372339,the question whether scale what has happened far ' scale till do 
372337," ' literally reiterating bit drama what liquity presented oracle summit nn "" better aligns values "" n "" decentralised backstop "" nnthey ' fully aware entire construct relies centralized entity setup even when switched backup continuously try default chainlink ' available nnit ' preferred choice fully hands cl instead using project "" better aligned values "" obviously ' gon na meme still go centralized one reasons pretty damn obvious nnthe moment cl "" gone "" liquity gon na do everything power fork ' why ' farce "
372335, s many reasons volatility eth need know every stablecoin built overcollateralized asset model fraction fraction either dai frax s mcap coincidence should take real world data heart clearly illustrating point lusdfeisusdrai combined do nt even reach 800m market cap although love individual unique innovations something learn teams world class incredibly small re trying build stablecoin ants simply going grow past certain size using models crypto does have evidence single overcollateralizedonly stablecoin grows size rather shrinks time 
372334,no frank think real challenge decentralized stablecoins does appear actual way scale without taking real world custody aka fiatcoin risk mentioned yesterday let forward what wrote 
372333,as whether would actually go 0 torn still well 0 
372331,so would say biggest risk decentralized stables may oracles  ?  nncan create purely chain dataset 1  ?  eth stable eth wbtc swap values allow us derive value 1 rough draft how system could work nncould cut price feeds chain sources create immutable chain unit accounting where data sets always derive values  ?  
372330,not sure why think doubling lie answer question 
372328, what does have do pretending re exclusively dependent chainlink  ?

372318,might well do also let usdc holders vote right  ?   
372315,does make fiatcoin wrapper dependent 2 daos  ?  
372313,they would branded lqty governance token good attempt 
372310,the entirety argument muddy waters claiming we re since use chainlink s oracles we re better way get blacklisted chainlink pretendao do something when reality possible fix problem liquity chainlink dependency completely irrelevant simply go straight dao point moot best 
372299,so does lusd chainlink pretendao 
372296, sure what re talking literally go appfraxfinance daistatscom get real time transparent view how much frax dai fiat wrapped took 20 minutes arguing admit lusd chainlink pretendao should call even guess  ?  
372293,yep that s basically what i m saying effect lusd like pretendao like call pretendao chainlink rather something else 
372292, ya what m saying 
372290, re claiming governance would solve hypothetical problem governance propose has failure state 
372289, dont understand what you re saying thing i m pointing lusd immutable cant even change oracle way hardfork new token addresssystem contract bad everyone must already implicitely trust chainlink oracle keep serving liquity holding lusd 
372288,last 60 days polygon single address fulfilled requests nnalso let ' kid moment chainlink would blacklist everybody would stop using lusd 
372287, ca nt put smart contract jail either how useful  ?  nnwhat stops tokenholders voting dead address new oracle  ?  
372286, ca nt put dao jail mean actual msig signers something oracle setting should onchain tokenholder vote like governorbravo type contract since critical stablecoin system like lusd makerdao s oracles actually well done terms how need updated 
372284,you simply ask dao brick end jail wan na see how many people willing risk freedom online voting game  ?  
372283,if pretendao would need go chainlink 
372282, k cool still does nt change fact lusd fake dao would entirely rekt chainlink updated contracts remove great point guess 
372281, s what practice 
372278,you re thinking what you re proposing attack you re proposing lusd would completely unnecessary pretendao would simply need go said pretendao 
372277, report price accurately often tellor does nt do either least past 
372276,so long someone willing report price should continue work 
372274,agreed 100 protocol has certain strengths value propositions though none perfect 
372266,what mim 
372265, think important thing understand tradeoffs people saying lusd impervious things dai frax weak quite right daifrax impervious lot things simple fixes us would rek lusd force redeploy everything basically dead 
372264,oracles issue plagues solidity chainlink center point failure code oracle source ever screwed go should pull basket oracle feeds self twap value 
372263, requires goverance s way someone have release contracts update front end 
372262,do redeploy upgradable oracles  ?  redeploy immutable contracts  ?  nnif nr2 would use ' gon na migrate new version everytime face oracle troubles  ?  
372261, why change governance instead  ?  s point should governable s stablecoin s like s uniswap base layer consensus contracts anything 
372259,yep precisely would 
372258, does nt work ve integrated lusd protocol every single thing stack would also need change 
372256, ca nt create new contracts get ppl convert  ?  long way around usually works get ppl close positions time migrate mean someone deployed intial contracts right someone could deploy new ones 
372255,that would make sense something like uniswap amm basically tool needs nonchanging structure doesnt make sense anything trying stable value 
372254, totally which why ve always confused lusd holders bragging how literally nothing code ever changeable s forever immutable 
372251, guess nt instant fair like said code continues report last price reported oracles should hopefully give enough time lusd holders sell everything have s late d assume peg would even volatile currently right s kind great outcome either 
372249,but could argued chainlink blacklists ' kinda 
372246,nope none entirely immutable decentralized lqty has gov rights 
372244,"think major issue ' trying peg anything first place nnwe either deal centralized entities issuing wrap shit 10 times centralized oracles making possible governance able attack ,, peg "" nnall which ' sound promising tbh ' compromises top compromises "

375493,like said ' trust execution snapshot model onchain vote what matters 
375491,dude have optimistic governance which means also have msig do bunch stuff make nopedao veto rules unless vote  have constructive conversation how figure things good faith amicably team would talk us affected daos etc have responded single thing saying it s onchain laughable point please fool shame fool twice

364695,issue counterparty buyer matchingnnthere projects solve pooled liquidity lps wouldnt expose themselfs pool unknown risknnits kind chicken egg problemnpeer peer rfq otc derivatives could solve 
364694, users thing ephemeral people do nt care predictions except handful niches which illegal andor well regulated which point either close shop like have accept fate super niche rest 
364693,more handful projects have done way users 
364692, solve product design how works practice cost issue course biggest challenge how design d secret sauce nnthought someone must have figured least design operational issues 
364691,considering people have funded things issue lot bigger mere marketing 
364690, liquidity issue boils marketing issue ye enough counterparty predictability thereof index like product would provide liquidity s bundle bets guess do nt know kalshi pipe sure 
364689, core seems boil product design problem could try answer how do package format index like product people already know how trade how could invent new product s easy understand people would trade ie kalshi pipe nnif figure 1 2 liquidity issue becomes partnership marketing issue getting enough people trade make markets cost structure profitability issue well technical operational etc  ?  
364688, hmmm what causes liquidity issue exactly  ?  typically s matter types products have right  ?  have niche events enough people care do nt see interest solution really better sales  ?  
364687, believe fall prediction market category known problem would liquidity 
364686,hmmm sort tangential has anyone ever tried launch product where bet volume return ranking different tradinginvestment firms ie oh fund x return fund year what given fund x pmusing strategies ball park 
364684,it could misguided could possibly see someone thinking hey detect security flaws post social media anyone else maybe they ll impressed use service nnif product good what said might advice need dont go around pissing people listening part would course

360622, think involves separating tpg rpi tbh when sum comes wo nt even able calculate native psus 
360619, cool s one approach go 4 whoever does m advocating reinventing wheel 
360618,so what native support  ?  replacing bios efi  ?  installing new tpm chip  ?  do need entirely new processor architectures  ?  
360617,you also know oses have module support enabling code loaded kernel which enables native support without writing entire new os  ?  
360616, tell re getting frustrated isis dis de wei make point have others have 
360614,you know user code runs processor right  ?  has access hardware os  ?  
360611,ivan going ban say last time one has named single os feature would improve apps obviously do need custom os improve apps 
360610, do nt want see another software company pretend do hardware fail crypto crypto separate issue 
360608,why do need os when dos 
360606,why 
360605,does anyone know valuation stepn raised  ?  
360604,why though 
360601,why make custom rom work hardware available  ?

360599, reason do nt have cryptospecific many things 
360598,please finalize ur arguments has 130 messages haha sorry 3 
360597, why do nt have cryptospecific desktop oses  ?  mean should nt issues apply  ?  
360596, Ai Ya  do nt think re likely agree think ivangbi gon na get irritated circular arguments eventually lol 
360595,if os level support needed someone should able give example right  ?  
360593, re unhappy current crypto apps cool should make better app 
360592, right well have nt described anything needs os support improve 
360591, have said beginning arguing os app hardware per se 
360587,do think people went buy samsung phones  ?  
360585, would nice stopped pretending re breaking new ground nt something one recent history has done 
360582,you must have different levels patience crypto apps phones 
360581,you havent actually mentioned anything phone could potentially useful beyond what current phones do well enough though there s part experience made better oslevel integration 
360579, m discussing what crypto native phone could potentially useful least view think solana wise going arena although have doubts ll able deliver 
360577,so how put away breathless praise governance model announce something substantial produced  ?  
360576,we have limited information 
360575, do nt represent solana have idea what thing do lol 
360573, could argue whether needed pinch zoom whatever whether wanted hardware keyboard made actual claims what thing could do why d want 
360572,do think people went buy samsung phones  ?  
360571, fact quite obvious thing lived demo going change everything question whether would live demonnand yes people said nt need anyway surennbut do nt even have demo compelling features 
360569, solana phone nt changing world we s giving normies experienced obsessively documenting lives anew device which ll do chain 
360568, familiar particular topic s why s reminiscent days months heard type stuff people actually got experience phone 
360564,you clearly watch when presented 
360563, thing has anything really announced re crapping lol 
360560,when last time watched product announcement  ?  
360559,it obvious how iphone browser differed featurephone browsers 
360552,he laid extremely compelling case why wanted iphone obvious anyone watching presentation world changed 
360551,worse people do buy phones order interact brockshane interaction simply one things do 
360550,like have seen 2007 presentation jobs gave  ?  
360549,how would possibly know ' even launched yet u0001f923 
360548, re reinventing anything whatever re supposed offer something already do 
360547, do nt s obviously parallelnnmp3 players enabled something nt possible optical media tons problems magnetic media mp3 players easy response question m asking carry entire album pocket go running without skipping do nt have rewind possible existing technnthe iphone first phone have browser actually worked touchscreen responsive enough navigate web pagennthis app 
360543, maybe argued have walkmen do nt need mp3 players have phones apps like weird one tmobile why do need apple app store  ?  
360542,this noise around when samsung offered sdk interact ethereum  ?  
360541, do nt see parallels  ?  
360538, do nt wan na ad hominem please do nt take way around adult when iphone first came when mp3 players came chance  ?  
360536, hard customize android os do tons things user does nt have do customization 
360535,what os level features do exist today need implemented work properly  ?  
360534, saying hardware bad idea either btw have nt thought s natural place have quick debate someone 
360533, s interesting s handwaving s app launches when hit nfc tag app controls experience 
360531,why  ?  why giving apps  ?  what benefit do get  ?  
360530,why earth would do  ?  
360529,doesn ' have certainly interesting approach might actually end good ux 
360528,sure could why  ?  metamask exists 
360525, have nt explained why needs hardware yet hard parts development users would get good experience developers have do hard work do nt need entire new device 
360524, do nt think do build os  ?  
360522,hell could launch wallet app ios when tapped nfc tag 
360521,see earlier points already done bad argument it s headache do 
360519,name two 
360518, originally answering someone s question what does someone using solana daily get  ?  yeah 
360515,ability natively tap send money via solana chain friend next mennability use biometrics confirm tx native browser do yield farming 
360513,name two 
360512, idk what plan do could envisage number things native implementation would look like would make life easier m utilizing crypto day day basis 
360511,and why do need make hardware do  ?  
360510,you have said words concrete information what exactly would different app running os vs existing one  ?  
360509,what native implementation os  ?  
360508, point something possible like paying bill method headache like sending checks does nt mean gets done well when something easiernnso app go phones rn makes possible do crypto tx does nt get adoption could bc s headachennif decent os native implementation combined phone hopefully good hardware security comes point obvious adoption usage increases things equalnnergo good idea solana do probably useful general crypto adoption 
360507, think should simplify what phone do which mine cant  ?  why cant current do  ?  why worth much  ?  
360506,what does hardware need support current phones do  ?  
360505, remember re talking android have tons room screw around os features 
360504,can explain cheap seats what exactly gain dedicated phone task vs app launched phone 
360503,lol yeah literally point doesnt take 20 steps pay bill takes many steps deliberately name muscle movement step 
360502,the problem has less do flaws solana do selling phone 
360501,yeah feels like solana dumb therefore everything do has hated us 
360500, look rates repayment bills when do nt have send check instead use cc via websitennit s 1000 increase debt repaymentnnso kind make point yes 
360499,this thoughtful commentary havent provided single reason why phone which optimized way run blockchain client would better existing phone which run app including blockchain client 
360497,oh come like meme where someone lists 20 steps necessary pay bill check including licking stamp putting stamp envelope separate steps open app phone does blockchain shit what should netflix button phone  ?  
360496, said s built android would obviously able do everything else 
360495,can do everything do current phone need carry 2 phones  ?  need another phone next project do 
360493, people use phones much making blockchain transactions one sad do nt have phone has native support making crypto tx 
360492,being able do tons headache vs able do easily natively what sets adoption vs obsolescence apart software 
360491,can ape phone do something current one  ?  have gated access app which apk would work elsewhere  ?  
360488,yeah does feel like 2008 tbh 
360487, re basically suggesting should move back feature phones 
360486, do nt get do phone wait actually ca nt solana nt functioning  
360483,an os runs one application people already make phones oses which run applications why do need make phone run single app  ?  
360482,your phone does everything does apps already best thing changes backend which users could care less 
360480,why do need produce entire tiny computer run single app  ?  
360479, wanted do tx say pos stephangoss mentioned p2p tx anything else would nt have jump fifty hoops do 
360478, s actually il bnt tanked could nt cover il turned il protection think 
360477,so where loss going  ?  why discreptancy  ?  
360475,what does mean  ?  
360474,native ability do crypto tx without really garbage third party apps hope 
360473, excellent question forget what phone offers people do nt use solana moment bought ecosystem fully what does do  ?  
360472,celsius withdrew 2000 ether bancor actually got 1200 making snark how permanent loss impermanent loss bancor still working designed 
360470,what advantage do think phone offers people currently using solana  ?  
360468, one has take weird crypto token hell outside blockchain space even knows what sol  ?  works everyone nt even have build entire phone do 
360467,with what  ?  
360466, have s called crypto debit card attached apple pay 
360464,abuilt hardware wallet integrates natively point sales systems real life payments would huge advantage 
360463, database starts working primary area expertise broken they re going add new completely different area endeavor think going have positive result  ?  
360461,how phone competitive advantage blockchain space 
360460,it means database starts working have phone ' massie competitive advantage 
360459,lmao what does phone have do blockchain validates something traditionally organized orgs sure they ll do stupid things attempt bandwagon get publicity 
360458,its like samsung would launch diesel engine car display 
360457, what  ?  database nt even working launching phone what world mean 
360456,il protection still active permanent loss dont protect 
360453,solana phone conversation should have responded sry 
360452,wrong chat  ?  what responding  ?

338877,the problem death note still getting paid 2995k should worth what negative reputation worth crypto  ?  
338870,so question becomes do want raise money  ?  retail  ?  sure dump moment receive airdrop 
338869,however how different angels  ?  
338868,but honestly have rotten apples everywhere vcs which truly toxic detrimental vc reputation 
338865,hmm possibly guess perspective matters regards latter part why  ?  vc could have internal auditing team help portcos jump queue trail bits openzeppelin 
338863,is like how tether has negative reputation sense ahem virtuesignaling people talking keeps chugging along really talk  ?  
338862, offering help code one thing probably do nt want publicly say audited vc firm audits supposed independent examination conflict interest degree retail already sceptic vcs do nt think would perceived wellnnyou would have create credibility vc firm have expertise etc way simpler make partnership auditing firm could even invest 
338861,how certain  ?  
338858,we agree general vcs have negative reputation space competition increases crypto native vcs raising shit load capital web2tradfi institutions entering space higher strategic value add required demanded crypto projectsprotocols providing gtm support bd tokenomics introductionsnetwork becoming less strategic day vcs have keep boosting value add remain relevant space therefore offering tech support product testing feedback governance support audits crazy may think 
338856, m gon na name which vc tell s happening 
338855,how vcs poaching hiring auditors top tier auditing firms establish internal auditing division team  ?  matter fact already happening within vc landscape it s strange would think 
338854,but case event people always point fingers least would want have internal audit team fault correct  ?  
338844,actually second thought ' making good point smarter structure would vc firm do bulk deal someone like trail bits allow portfolio companies pick auditing time ' even matter expensive anymore ' basically impossible even get time vc firm guarantees access would have big leg getting cap table 
338838," sure really arguing topic lost feels like fugezi convo answer question anybody knows r free suggest add warning answer "" someone look code "" going diet 50 cheat days like... might have first place "

338789,its unsolvable problem imho person has possibility do stupid thing do stupid thing take possibility away taking part custody rights away 
338787, thank farm42 lafayettetabor qubes good d like have mobile device try mmk airgap 
338786, suppose  ?  impression prevented transfers nanyways wrap eip1167 asset appear static transfer rights access smart wallet does nt matter exact way rvst work lqdr gets around base curve mechanics have one lock per wallet - use contractbased smart wallets tied nfts allow staking via proxy custom smartwalletchecker whitelist everything taking liquidity vecrv positions 
338785,my opinion never able fix give people self custody going do stupid things way solve taking custody away thats called web2 
338784,fair still have ton people clicking random things even like 15 years 
338783, think point guardian contract 721 disable transfers contractlevelnmind s useful person compromising wallet does nt realize valuable have seen exact scenario play revest -xa0someone lost private keys hacker took everything fnfts containing value rest assets put together nt know what impacted user able wait month return wallet transfer impacted assets hacker moved nnsecurity obscurity nt secure method still break hackers figure what going 
338782,yeah idea makes sense basically non custodial staking tries address problem verify onchain do verification onchain whether someone moves assets therefore reliably distribute rewards based basically hook notifies staking contract when asset moved 
338781, yes s what d recommend however see angle guy coming 
338779, really keep address secured hardware wallet do nt stake dubious ponzis 
338778, guess do nt really snark s hiding which addresses owned nfts s still better guardian address has custody nfts 
338775,yeah thought revest clone first it s something bit different have similar function fnfts though standardized manner concept decent one however existence smart wallets kinda obviates true staking mechanism use eip1167 deploy smart wallet lock assets smart wallet transfer ownership smart wallet nft 
338774,hmm why set tornadocash like zk based nfts  ?  still have inplace virtual staking instead guardian transfer nft address have backup key 
338773,but would advise use hardware wallet 
338772,its best get wan na do sophisticated stuff 
338770,better learning how use qubes virtualization

338762, think does work default nfts base requirement nft complies githubcomowlofmoistnesserc721lockregistry  ?  nnit basically allows staking giving sort benefit user long asset control without actually move another contract 
338761, m reading feel idea ok nfts would pain many trxs u do erc20 where nfts u have idle wallet 
338759, assets locked guardian transferred user still holds ownership assets nnif directly transferred user does have ownership 
338758, could nt do something like eth pos cause slashing  ?  
338755,sorry ser felt differently bad nnanyhow guess u say kinda multisig specific assets think u make kind guardian staking contract where u stake erc assets security measure think would need testing thinking bet lot people got hacked would live have way save assets even though got hacked think staking implemented token

338595,with tax season sending people insane would really appreciate input attempt make overall experience way better people thanks  
338590,ser does mean trading soon ser 
338576, also most rare nfts have redundancy 2 meaning code hold unlock also 1 nft one needs unlock part code available hold 1 category take chances play hard ball hope have duplicates idea community unlocks creative way instead holding protocol hostage 90 days 
338572,oh potions needed unlock do use get tokens have minimum needed finish launch would able hold entire system ransom  ?  interesting 
338571,if have significant part codebase holdout demand certain things else ' release ur part secret unlocked early think got bonus sorts 
338570,with potion unlock what tldr game theory behind unlocking early vs late  ?  
338555, actually surprised would add avax reason 
338554,anyone else noticed do larping choosing eth reserve how smart contract platform competition means could replaced unlike btc goes add avax reserve anyway  ?  marketing reserve stability imo 
338551,he ' basically saying setup 4pool need deep liquidity swap ust usdc usdt buy btc ethereum kind size ' do terra cheaper incentivise 4pool enough liquidity sell luna otc large discounts dump luna market directly tank price r 
338542,well product which algo stable has working mechanism keeps peg why would pay incentivise sink  ?   ?   ?  
338532,okay do 
338530,could please record video screenshot send dm  ?  nnfor everyone give update chat well 
338528, looks like do nt get incognito have enabled metamask incognito 
338523,looks like everything alright suggest checking access another pc incognito...nnif someone might have able generate malicious valid cert like kakao recently tornado cash see nn crtsh  ?  qtornadocash 
338513,total noob question what editor good solidity js days  ?  
338511,yeah point protocol ownership should 100 abandoned protocols existence nearly 30b tvl governed 35 multisigs 
338507, multisigs nt good prevent compromise single keys turning power high value account re also good deter opportunists seeing target have knock get candy inside 
338506, s 20b account guy has control do nt think 5 wrenches coming way  ?  
338505, even do nt think authorities competent 20b bounty real life blackhats 
338504, make work oh stole 20b  ?  m really interested see how re going turn something usable willywonkajpg 
338503,but do negotiate imperfect human giving free money absolution 
338499, nt arbitrary numbers point do nt have give thief free money give back money stole instead track thief stop old fashioned way 
338496,how instead giving someone literally billions even millions instead make police report start investigating massive billions dollars stolen cash 
338492,if high what going change mind why take 25  ?  project still gets 75 back 
338490,18b slow death  ?  either way trying do best damage control point negotiating imperfect human part job 
338489, s incentive problem adding smart contract does nt change anything allnnthe hacker control funds choose whether accept projects offer 
338487, already got tweet suggesting add log function amount do nt know going usable 
338486, hmm how do even calculate 10  ?  tvl liquid money certainly capital team s control 
338484,hacker has spend next however long figuring how make 2b tornadoed funds something actually spend 
338483, quick death vs slow one where re making fraud feel good 
338482, do nt hacker tornados away what gain  ?  
338481,curve gets hacked they re worth tomorrow 10 2b that s what want pay flipflopping blackhats  ?  
338479,agreed have faced similar kind situation couple times 
338478, course do nt offer s ridiculous 
338477, stuff has chance beginning make sense tvl has meaningful relationship marketcap projects have handful projects defillamacom where marketcap 10 tvl including top 2 even bad s 1 
338476,but projects rarely offer 10 nand b when offer whatever hacker disclosed vulnerability has happened many many times project essentially tells fuck reducing severity delaying payments etc 
338474, kinda does nt add anything project offering 10 per normal disclosure 
338470,empirical data ser why many hackers decided go route instead otherwise  ?  
338468,how do suppose could implemented  ?  
338467,again how would know  ?  
338462,if hacked already u already have balls 
338461,what have best irrelevant correlation 
338460,the idea better position negotiate someone have balls hand 
338458, idea re supposed turn white 10 why make 25  ?  
338457,what 50 different addresses lping uni v3 position hacker wallet swapped stolen stuff senslessly fro eth random shitcoin collect fees ' whitewashed ' money ... 
338456,how would know  ?  
338452,btw what ' best way launder 600 mil  ?  asking fren 
338451,the first step where hacker would nope bounce 
338450, think generalize discussion white vs black hat people choose black hat 10 higher white hat bug bounty which cases nonexistant compared 10 
338449,this nightmare pr crypto media report hack without including recovery details regulators pull examples how crypto scam 
338441, what s difference escrow contract  ?  
338437,this means n hack already happenedn fund user fund r rektn address set third party which also might want feen-- otherwise address hacker why even do itn...

338420,also get what pay 
338419,the problem many audit firms prioritize code bugs economic exploits certainly dont audit team opsec audited projects keep getting hacked 
338418,if audit says dev has single key rug whole thing nonif audit says luks gud k tnx bye yes 
338414, expect problems arise audit do nt have data back hypothesis 
338413, think one people trying simplify level does honor reality whole audited projects gets hacked auditor blame mentality doesnt account bunch scenarios 
338412, audits marketing tools nthey ab used marketing purposes marketing certainly main concern auditnn auditors reputation should line project approve gets rektnwhat do mean  ?  nn protocol doesnt follow recommendations write audit reportndead end even project complies recommendations way auditor verify keep future means effectively revoke audited 
338410,audits marketing tools i ve done due dilligence feel confident investing protocol doesnt matter anyone does scientific research funds still got stolen faith auditor looking project interacted still got fucked auditors reputation should line project approve gets rekt protocol doesnt follow recommendations write audit report actually read findings audit company should allow protocol say audited when several versions behind etc

338166,what defi fixed income projects currently have traction  ?  approach makes sense  ?  
338162,maybe crazy question project founders what accounting platform do use  ?  ' trending quick books ' used anything better crypto  ?  
338161,depends what need honestly generally prefer bit wrapped keep surface interface minimal expose stuff absolutely need frontend scenarios typechain good enough 
338156, s really interesting understand correctly ts would wrap smart contract function calls expose typesafe interface would act documentation sorts see working completely new case s level keep idea mind 
338155,depends experience level frontend dev new web3 think would prefer give typescript wrapper takes care setting plumbing exposes interface makes easier consume frontend app 
338154, know s what m saying though rails facilitate efficiency governance process solve issues governance which unrelated efficiency governance process likely compound make even glaringly obvious 
338153,yeah much else do party lacks essential skillsknowledge have babysittrain replace 
338152, think trick tehcnogoly able do many tech support social process 
338151, yeah s what m actually debugging point badmouth dev best thinking would cool have tool exports sample projectdocs based natspec kind like swagger fe where shows how call given functions sample params point s easier help  
338149, do nt think blockchain ever solve issues related governance s like saying internet enabling ease communication make people better communicators 
338148, usually go call people walk different questions either works shows where trouble understanding documentation lies adjust 
338147, important have 
338142,living planet have managing extremely difficult goal balancing individual freedom desire happiness common responsibility have planetary boundaries questing infinite story better governance 
338141, have problems collaborating frontender implementing dapp based smart contracts wrote ie parameters clear something does nt work etc created docs partially helps ever problem how do guys go  ?

338133,can guys recommend proxy provider static ips which paid crypto  ?  
338131,when working policial matters 
338129, yeah agree when comparing think s good compare also existing mechanism parliaments also have good habit come 10 different solutions when confronted issue question what epistemic vs social process do achieve 
338128,not disagreeing commenting have 10 different jury ' exact trial ' likely end 10 consistent verdicts ' issue how good decision quality does engage public 
338127,the goal able integrate complexity human governance crypto ream go beyond what liberal democracies do which ok far far good 
338124, think liquid token voting delegate tokens people redelecte time likely better outcome hard get random people speed d end something similar us jury trials which nt really known particularly consistent 
338120,ah interesting sounds like swiss style governance where have 7 presidents executive board directors specializes one 7 departments 
338119,plus antisniping added proposals sure how day one
